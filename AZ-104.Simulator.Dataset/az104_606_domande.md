Your company has serval departments. Each department has a number of virtual machines (VMs). The company has an Azure subscription that contains a resource group named RG1. All VMs are located in RG1. You want to associate each VM with its respective department. What should you do?

- **A.** Create Azure Management Groups for each department.
- **B.** Create a resource group for each department.
- **C.** Assign tags to the virtual machines. **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Modify the settings of the virtual machines.

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To associate each virtual machine with its respective department in Azure, you should use tags. Tags in Azure are name/value pairs that can be assigned to resources such as virtual machines. By assigning tags that correspond to department names, you can easily categorize and identify which VMs belong to which departments without needing to modify the existing resource group structure or VM settings.

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements. Your company has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) subscription. You want to implement an Azure AD conditional access policy. The policy must be configured to require members of the Global Administrators group to use Multi- Factor Authentication and an Azure AD-joined device when they connect to Azure AD from untrusted locations. Solution: You access the multi-factor authentication page to alter the user settings. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Accessing the multi-factor authentication page to alter user settings allows you to configure multi- factor authentication requirements for users. However, to meet the goal of requiring members of the Global Administrators group to use Multi-Factor Authentication and an Azure AD-joined device when connecting to Azure AD from untrusted locations, you need to create a conditional access policy in Azure AD. Conditional access policies allow you to specify conditions, such as the user's group membership and their device's joining status, and enforce specific access controls based on these conditions.

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements. Your company has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) subscription. You want to implement an Azure AD conditional access policy. The policy must be configured to require members of the Global Administrators group to use Multi- Factor Authentication and an Azure AD-joined device when they connect to Azure AD from untrusted locations. Solution: You access the Azure portal to alter the session control of the Azure AD conditional access policy. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** The solution does not meet the goal because altering the session control of the Azure AD conditional access policy is not sufficient to enforce the required conditions for Multi-Factor Authentication and Azure AD-joined devices. To meet the goal, the policy should be configured by altering the grant control, not the session control. The grant control allows administrators to enforce access requirements such as Multi-Factor Authentication and device compliance, which are necessary for ensuring that members of the Global Administrators group use an Azure AD-joined device and MFA when connecting from untrusted locations.

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements. Your company has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) subscription. You want to implement an Azure AD conditional access policy. The policy must be configured to require members of the Global Administrators group to use Multi- Factor Authentication and an Azure AD-joined device when they connect to Azure AD from untrusted locations. Solution: You access the Azure portal to alter the grant control of the Azure AD conditional access policy. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** Yes. In a conditional access policy the requirements a user must satisfy to be granted access - here Require multi-factor authentication and Require an Azure AD joined (hybrid joined) device - are configured in the Grant control. The assignment to the Global Administrators group and the untrusted-locations condition complete the policy, but the access requirements themselves live in Grant; session controls only shape the experience inside an already granted session.

You are planning to deploy an Ubuntu Server virtual machine to your company's Azure subscription. You are required to implement a custom deployment that includes adding a particular trusted root certification authority (CA). Which of the following should you use to create the virtual machine?

- **A.** The New-AzureRmVm cmdlet.
- **B.** The New-AzVM cmdlet.
- **C.** The Create-AzVM cmdlet.
- **D.** The az vm create command. **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** To deploy an Ubuntu Server virtual machine in Azure with a custom deployment that includes adding a particular trusted root certification authority (CA), you should use the 'az vm create' command. This command, part of the Azure CLI (Command-Line Interface), supports various customization options, including the use of cloud-init scripts for configuration, which can handle the installation of a trusted root CA as part of the VM's initialization process. The other cmdlets mentioned either do not exist or do not provide the required level of customization. Using 'az vm create', you can employ the -- custom-data parameter to provide your cloud-init script, facilitating the custom deployment.

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements. Your company makes use of Multi-Factor Authentication for when users are not in the office. The Per Authentication option has been configured as the usage model. After the acquisition of a smaller business and the addition of the new staff to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) obtains a different company and adding the new employees to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you are informed that these employees should also make use of Multi-Factor Authentication. To achieve this, the Per Enabled User setting must be set for the usage model. Solution: You reconfigure the existing usage model via the Azure portal. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** The solution does not meet the goal. You cannot change the usage model (per enabled user or per authentication) after a Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) provider is created in Azure. Instead, you need to create a new MFA provider with the desired usage model settings to accommodate the new employees.

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements. Your company's Azure solution makes use of Multi-Factor Authentication for when users are not in the office. The Per Authentication option has been configured as the usage model. After the acquisition of a smaller business and the addition of the new staff to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) obtains a different company and adding the new employees to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you are informed that these employees should also make use of Multi-Factor Authentication. To achieve this, the Per Enabled User setting must be set for the usage model. Solution: You reconfigure the existing usage model via the Azure CLI. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** The solution does not meet the goal. Once a Multi-Factor Authentication provider is created, its usage model cannot be changed from 'Per Authentication' to 'Per Enabled User.' To achieve the goal of ensuring new employees use Multi-Factor Authentication under the 'Per Enabled User' setting, a new MFA provider would need to be created and activated with the new settings. Reconfiguring the existing usage model via the Azure CLI is not possible for changing the usage model.

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements. Your company's Azure solution makes use of Multi-Factor Authentication for when users are not in the office. The Per Authentication option has been configured as the usage model. After the acquisition of a smaller business and the addition of the new staff to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) obtains a different company and adding the new employees to Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you are informed that these employees should also make use of Multi-Factor Authentication. To achieve this, the Per Enabled User setting must be set for the usage model. Solution: You create a new Multi-Factor Authentication provider with a backup from the existing Multi- Factor Authentication provider data. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** Yes. The usage model of a Multi-Factor Authentication provider (per authentication or per enabled user) cannot be changed once the provider exists, neither from the portal nor from the CLI. To switch, you create a new provider with the per-enabled-user model, back up the data of the existing provider and restore it into the new one, then reactivate MFA Server with the new provider's credentials. Note that MFA providers are a legacy feature: since 1 September 2018 new providers can no longer be created and MFA is licensed per user instead.

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements. Your company has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named weyland.com that is configured for hybrid coexistence with the on-premises Active Directory domain.You have a server named DirSync1 that is configured as a DirSync server.You create a new user account in the on-premise Active Directory. You now need to replicate the user information to Azure AD immediately. Solution: You run the `Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Initial` PowerShell cmdlet. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Running the Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Initial PowerShell cmdlet initiates a full synchronization cycle. While this does replicate user information from on-premises Active Directory to Azure AD, it is not the most efficient method for immediate replication. The initial synchronization can take a considerable amount of time, especially if there are many changes or a large directory. For immediate replication of the newly created user account, the Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta cmdlet should be used instead. This delta synchronization only replicates the changes since the last synchronization, making it faster and more suitable for immediate needs.

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements. Your company has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named weyland.com that is configured for hybrid coexistence with the on-premises Active Directory domain.You have a server named DirSync1 that is configured as a DirSync server.You create a new user account in the on-premise Active Directory. You now need to replicate the user information to Azure AD immediately. Solution: You use Active Directory Sites and Services to force replication of the Global Catalog on a domain controller. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** The solution does not meet the goal because using Active Directory Sites and Services to force replication of the Global Catalog on a domain controller does not directly impact the synchronization process with Azure Active Directory. To replicate the new user information to Azure AD immediately, you should use Azure AD Connect, the synchronization tool designed for integrating on-premises Active Directory with Azure AD. A manual synchronization cycle needs to be triggered using Azure AD Connect to achieve the desired result.

Your company has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named weyland.com that is configured for hybrid coexistence with the on-premises Active Directory domain. You have a server named DirSync1 that is configured as a DirSync server. You create a new user account in the on-premise Active Directory. You now need to replicate the user information to Azure AD immediately. Solution: You restart the NetLogon service on a domain controller. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** The solution of restarting the NetLogon service on a domain controller does not meet the goal of immediately replicating the new user account information to Azure AD. The NetLogon service handles domain user login authentication and does not play a role in Azure AD synchronization. To replicate the user information to Azure AD immediately, you should manually run a synchronization cycle using the Azure AD Connect tool. This can be done using the PowerShell command Start- ADSyncSyncCycle with the PolicyType parameter set to Delta for a quick sync or Initial for a full sync.

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements. Your company has an azure subscription that includes a storage account, a resource group, a blob container and a file share. A colleague named Jon Ross makes use of a solitary Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to deploy a virtual machine and an additional Azure Storage account. You want to review the ARM template that was used by Jon Ross. Solution: You access the Virtual Machine blade. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To review the ARM template used by Jon Ross to deploy a virtual machine and an additional Azure Storage account, one must access the Resource Group blade. The Virtual Machine blade only provides information specific to the virtual machine itself, not the overarching ARM template used for the combined deployment of multiple resources. Accessing the deployment history within the Resource Group blade allows for a complete view of all resources deployed, including the VM and the storage account, and hence is the appropriate place to review the ARM template.

Your company has three virtual machines (VMs) that are included in an availability set. You try to resize one of the VMs, which returns an allocation failure message. It is imperative that the VM is resized. Which of the following actions should you take?

- **A.** You should only stop one of the VMs.
- **B.** You should stop two of the VMs.
- **C.** You should stop all three VMs. **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** You should remove the necessary VM from the availability set.

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** If a VM within an availability set needs to be resized and an allocation failure occurs, it indicates that the necessary resources for the new size are not available on the current physical hardware cluster. In order to resize the VM to a size that is supported on a different hardware cluster, all VMs in the availability set must be stopped. This is because the availability set must use the same physical hardware cluster, and stopping all VMs allows them to be moved to a different cluster with the required resources. Therefore, stopping all three VMs in the availability set is necessary before resizing any individual VM.

You have an Azure virtual machine (VM) that has a single data disk. You have been tasked with attaching this data disk to another Azure VM. You need to make sure that your strategy allows for the virtual machines to be offline for the least amount of time possible. Which of the following is the action you should take FIRST?

- **A.** Stop the VM that includes the data disk.
- **B.** Stop the VM that the data disk must be attached to.
- **C.** Detach the data disk. **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Delete the VM that includes the data disk.

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** The appropriate step to take first is to detach the data disk. In Azure, data disks can be detached from a running virtual machine without the need to stop it. This allows for the minimal downtime of virtual machines. Ensuring the data disk is detached first enables it to be attached to another VM without affecting the operation of the currently running VM. It is essential, however, that no processes are actively using the data disk at the time of detachment to avoid data corruption, but this does not necessitate stopping the VM.

Your company has an Azure subscription. You need to deploy a number of Azure virtual machines (VMs) using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. You have been informed that the VMs will be included in a single availability set. You are required to make sure that the ARM template you configure allows for as many VMs as possible to remain accessible in the event of fabric failure or maintenance. Which of the following is the value that you should configure for the platformFaultDomainCount property?

- **A.** 10
- **B.** 30
- **C.** Min Value
- **D.** Max Value **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** In Azure, each availability set can be configured with a maximum of up to 3 fault domains. Configuring the platformFaultDomainCount property to the maximum value ensures that as many VMs as possible remain accessible in the event of a fabric failure or maintenance. This maximizes fault tolerance by distributing VMs across multiple fault domains.

Your company has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant that is configured for hybrid coexistence with the on-premises Active Directory domain. The on-premise virtual environment consists of virtual machines (VMs) running on Windows Server 2012 R2 Hyper-V host servers. You have created some PowerShell scripts to automate the configuration of newly created VMs. You plan to create several new VMs. You need a solution that ensures the scripts are run on the new VMs. Which of the following is the best solution?

- **A.** Configure a SetupComplete.cmd batch file in the %windir%\setup\scripts directory.
- **B.** Configure a Group Policy Object (GPO) to run the scripts as logon scripts.
- **C.** Configure a Group Policy Object (GPO) to run the scripts as startup scripts. **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Place the scripts in a new virtual hard disk (VHD).

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that the PowerShell scripts are run on new VMs, the best solution is to configure a Group Policy Object (GPO) to run the scripts as startup scripts. This method runs the scripts during the system startup, which is suitable for automating configuration tasks regardless of user logins. Unlike logon scripts, startup scripts do not require an interactive user session, making them more appropriate for tasks that need to be performed on every machine startup. This approach provides better manageability and scalability for ongoing operations and simplifies the deployment of configuration scripts across multiple VMs.

Your company has an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant that is configured for hybrid coexistence with the on-premises Active Directory domain. You plan to deploy several new virtual machines (VMs) in Azure. The VMs will have the same operating system and custom software requirements. You configure a reference VM in the on-premise virtual environment. You then generalize the VM to create an image. You need to upload the image to Azure to ensure that it is available for selection when you create the new Azure VMs. Which PowerShell cmdlets should you use?

- **A.** Add-AzVM
- **B.** Add-AzVhd **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Add-AzImage
- **D.** Add-AzImageDataDisk

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To upload a generalized virtual hard disk (VHD) from an on-premises environment to Azure, the correct PowerShell cmdlet to use is 'Add-AzVhd'. This cmdlet specifically uploads a VHD file to Azure, making it available for future use, such as creating virtual machines. Other cmdlets listed are used for different tasks: 'Add-AzVM' is for creating new VMs, 'Add-AzImage' is to manage VM images but not for direct upload, and 'Add-AzImageDataDisk' is for adding a data disk to an image. Therefore, 'Add- AzVhd' is the appropriate cmdlet for uploading the VHD file to Azure.

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements. Your company's Azure subscription includes two Azure networks named VirtualNetworkA and VirtualNetworkB. VirtualNetworkA includes a VPN gateway that is configured to make use of static routing. Also, a site- to-site VPN connection exists between your company's on- premises network and VirtualNetworkA. You have configured a point-to-site VPN connection to VirtualNetworkA from a workstation running Windows 10. After configuring virtual network peering between VirtualNetworkA and VirtualNetworkB, you confirm that you are able to access VirtualNetworkB from the company's on-premises network. However, you find that you cannot establish a connection to VirtualNetworkB from the Windows 10 workstation. You have to make sure that a connection to VirtualNetworkB can be established from the Windows 10 workstation. Solution: You choose the Allow gateway transit setting on VirtualNetworkA. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Choosing the Allow gateway transit setting on VirtualNetworkA does not solve the issue. This setting allows a peered virtual network to use the VPN gateway for cross-premises connectivity. However, it does not enable connectivity from a point-to-site VPN connection to a peered virtual network. To enable this, you must reconfigure the point-to-site VPN client package on the Windows 10 workstation after making topology changes. Additionally, enabling gateway transit on VirtualNetworkB and ensuring proper routes and VPN gateway configuration on VirtualNetworkB are necessary to establish the desired connectivity.

Your company has virtual machines (VMs) hosted in Microsoft Azure. The VMs are located in a single Azure virtual network named VNet1. The company has users that work remotely. The remote workers require access to the VMs on VNet1. You need to provide access for the remote workers. What should you do?

- **A.** Configure a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN.
- **B.** Configure a VNet-toVNet VPN.
- **C.** Configure a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN. **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Configure DirectAccess on a Windows Server 2012 server VM.
- **E.** Configure a Multi-Site VPN

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To provide remote workers with access to the virtual machines hosted in Azure, the appropriate solution is to configure a Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN. A P2S VPN allows individual clients to securely connect to a virtual network from any location with an internet connection. This is ideal for remote workers who may be working from different locations, such as their homes or while traveling. Site-to- Site VPNs connect entire networks, VNet-to-VNet VPNs connect different Azure virtual networks, DirectAccess is outdated, and a Multi-Site VPN connects multiple on-premises sites to Azure, none of which are appropriate for individual remote worker access.

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements. Your company has a Microsoft SQL Server Always On availability group configured on their Azure virtual machines (VMs). You need to configure an Azure internal load balancer as a listener for the availability group. Solution: You create an HTTP health probe on port 1433. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** The solution does not meet the goal. In order to configure an Azure internal load balancer as a listener for a SQL Server Always On availability group, a TCP health probe on port 1433 is required. Port 1433 is used for SQL Server Database Engine connections, and an HTTP health probe is not suitable for this purpose.

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements. Your company has a Microsoft SQL Server Always On availability group configured on their Azure virtual machines (VMs). You need to configure an Azure internal load balancer as a listener for the availability group. Solution: You set Session persistence to Client IP. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** The solution does not meet the goal. When configuring an Azure internal load balancer as a listener for a Microsoft SQL Server Always On availability group, ensuring proper load balancing and failover requires using 'Floating IP (direct server return)' configuration. This involves setting specific health probes and rules to ensure traffic is directed correctly to the active SQL Server instance. Setting only 'Client IP' for session persistence does not satisfy these requirements and may not provide the necessary redundancy and failover capabilities needed for an availability group.

Note: The question is included in a number of questions that depicts the identical set-up. However, every question has a distinctive result. Establish if the solution satisfies the requirements. Your company has a Microsoft SQL Server Always On availability group configured on their Azure virtual machines (VMs). You need to configure an Azure internal load balancer as a listener for the availability group. Solution: You enable Floating IP. Does the solution meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** In the context of configuring an Azure internal load balancer as a listener for a SQL Server Always On availability group, enabling Floating IP (Direct Server Return) is indeed necessary. This configuration allows the load balancer to handle the failover by assigning the floating IP address to the active SQL Server instance in the availability group. The floating IP ensures that the listener IP address remains consistent for client connections even during failover scenarios. Therefore, the solution meets the goal.

Your company has two on-premises servers named SRV01 and SRV02. Developers have created an application that runs on SRV01. The application calls a service on SRV02 by IP address. You plan to migrate the application on Azure virtual machines (VMs). You have configured two VMs on a single subnet in an Azure virtual network. You need to configure the two VMs with static internal IP addresses. What should you do?

- **A.** Run the New-AzureRMVMConfig PowerShell cmdlet.
- **B.** Run the Set-AzureSubnet PowerShell cmdlet.
- **C.** Modify the VM properties in the Azure Management Portal. **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Modify the IP properties in Windows Network and Sharing Center.
- **E.** Run the Set-AzureStaticVNetIP PowerShell cmdlet.

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** In Azure the private IP address belongs to the VM's network interface, not to the guest OS: in the portal open the network interface, go to IP configurations and switch the assignment from Dynamic to Static. Setting the address inside Windows (Network and Sharing Center) breaks connectivity, because Azure DHCP is what delivers the address to the VM, while Set-AzureStaticVNetIP and Set-AzureSubnet belong to the retired classic deployment model.

- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** The New-AzureADUser cmdlet is used to create new user accounts within an organization's Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). However, to create guest user accounts for external users, you should use the New-AzureADMSInvitation cmdlet, which is designed to invite external users to your directory. The New-AzureADMSInvitation cmdlet sends an invitation to the external user, allowing them to join the Azure AD tenant as a guest user. Therefore, using New-AzureADUser does not meet the goal of creating guest user accounts for the 500 external users.

- **D.** a Security group that uses the Dynamic User membership type
- **E.** a Security group that uses the Dynamic Device membership type

**Risposta corretta:** A, C

**Spiegazione:** To meet the requirements of granting access to a temporary Microsoft SharePoint document library and ensuring that the groups are deleted automatically after 180 days, you should create groups that support expiration policies. This functionality is supported by Microsoft 365 groups. The Microsoft 365 groups support expiration policies, which can automatically remove groups and their associated services after a set time period. Therefore, the correct answers are a Microsoft 365 group that uses the Assigned membership type and a Microsoft 365 group that uses the Dynamic User membership type. These types of groups ensure compliance with the requirement of automatic deletion.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a resource group named RG26. RG26 is set to the West Europe location and is used to create temporary resources for a project. RG26 contains the resources shown in the following table. SQLDB01 is backed up to RGV1. When the project is complete, you attempt to delete RG26 from the Azure portal. The deletion fails. You need to delete RG26. What should you do FIRST?

- **A.** Delete VM1
- **B.** Stop VM1
- **C.** Stop the backup of SQLDB01 **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Delete sa001

**Risposta corretta:** C
> Esibito: q055_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** In order to successfully delete a resource group in Azure, all dependencies within the group must be removed first. In this scenario, RG26 contains a Recovery Services vault (RGV1), which includes a backup of SQLDB01. Azure does not allow the deletion of a Recovery Services vault if it contains any backup data. To resolve this, you need to stop the backup service of SQLDB01 and ensure that all backup data is removed. Once this is done, you can proceed with deleting RG26.

You have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named contosocloud.onmicrosoft.com. Your company has a public DNS zone for contoso.com. You add contoso.com as a custom domain name to Azure AD. You need to ensure that Azure can verify the domain name. Which type of DNS record should you create?

- **A.** MX **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** NSEC
- **C.** PTR
- **D.** RRSIG

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To verify a custom domain name in Azure Active Directory, you need to create a DNS record to prove that you own the domain. The types of records that can be used for this verification are typically TXT or MX records. Since the available options do not include TXT, the appropriate choice would be an MX record. MX records are traditionally used to direct email traffic, but they can also be used for domain ownership verification in this context. NSEC and RRSIG are related to DNSSEC, and PTR records are used for reverse DNS lookups, making them unsuitable for domain verification in Azure AD.

Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution. After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You have an Azure Directory (Azure AD) tenant named Adatum and an Azure Subscription named Subscription1. Adatum contains a group named Developers. Subscription1 contains a resource group named Dev. You need to provide the Developers group with the ability to create Azure logic apps in the Dev resource group. Solution: On Subscription1, you assign the DevTest Labs User role to the Developers group. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Assigning the DevTest Labs User role does not provide the necessary permissions to create Azure logic apps. This role is focused on managing virtual machines within Azure DevTest Labs, such as connecting to them, starting, restarting, and shutting them down. To meet the goal of providing the Developers group the ability to create Azure logic apps, a more specific role like the Logic App Contributor role should be assigned, as it includes permissions to manage logic apps, including viewing, editing, and updating them.

You have an Azure subscription linked to an Azure Active Directory tenant. The tenant includes a user account named User1. You need to ensure that User1 can assign a policy to the tenant root management group. What should you do?

- **A.** Assign the Owner role for the Azure Subscription to User1, and then modify the default conditional access policies.
- **B.** Assign the Owner role for the Azure subscription to User1, and then instruct User1 to configure access management for Azure resources.
- **C.** Assign the Global administrator role to User1, and then instruct User1 to configure access management for Azure resources. **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Create a new management group and delegate User1 as the owner of the new management group.

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that User1 can assign a policy to the tenant root management group, User1 must have the necessary permissions at the tenant root management group level. The Global Administrator role in Azure Active Directory has the ability to elevate themselves to gain access to the root management group. Once they have that access, they can assign roles and configure policies at that level. Therefore, the correct approach would be to assign the Global Administrator role to User1 and then instruct them to configure access management for Azure resources, which allows them to manage the necessary permissions effectively.

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1 that contains an Azure Log Analytics workspace named Workspace1. You need to view the error events from a table named Event. Which query should you run in Workspace1?

- **A.** Get-Event Event | where {$_.EventType == "error"}
- **B.** Event | search "error" **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** select * from Event where EventType == "error"
- **D.** search in (Event) * | where EventType -eq "error"

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To view the error events from a table named Event in Azure Log Analytics, the query syntax used should be in Kusto Query Language (KQL). The correct KQL query that fits this requirement is Event | search "error". This query searches for the term 'error' across all columns in the Event table, which directly meets the need to view error events.

You have a registered DNS domain named contoso.com. You create a public Azure DNS zone named contoso.com. You need to ensure that records created in the contoso.com zone are resolvable from the internet. What should you do?

- **A.** Create NS records in contoso.com.
- **B.** Modify the SOA record in the DNS domain registrar.
- **C.** Create the SOA record in contoso.com.
- **D.** Modify the NS records in the DNS domain registrar. **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that records created in the contoso.com zone are resolvable from the internet, you need to delegate the domain to Azure DNS. This is done by modifying the NS (Name Server) records at the DNS domain registrar for contoso.com to point to the Azure DNS name servers. This will make the Azure DNS zone authoritative for the domain, allowing it to resolve the DNS queries for contoso.com.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named storage1. The subscription is linked to an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named contoso.com that syncs to an on-premises Active Directory domain. The domain contains the security principals shown in the following table. In Azure AD, you create a user named User2. The storage1 account contains a file share named share1 and has the following configurations. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** You can assign the Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor role to User1 for share1. -> Yes | You can assign the Storage File Data SMB Share Reader role to Computer1 for share1. -> No | You can assign the Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor role to User2 for share1. -> No

> Esibito: q084_pre0.png, q084_pre1.png, q084_pre2.png

**Spiegazione:** Share-level access to an Azure file share is granted through Azure RBAC roles, but with AD DS identity-based authentication only hybrid identities can actually be authorized: the account must exist in the on-premises AD DS domain and be synced to Azure AD. User1 is a domain user synced to contoso.com, so the Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor role can be assigned to it: Yes. Computer1 is a computer account, and neither on-premises AD DS nor Azure AD DS authentication supports authenticating computer accounts, so it cannot be granted share-level access: No. User2 was created directly in Azure AD and never existed in the on-premises domain, so it is not a hybrid identity and cannot be authenticated against AD DS for share1: No. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-identity-ad-ds-assign-permissions and https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/files/storage-files-active-directory-overview

- **C.** The display name of each user only
- **D.** The display name and usage location of each user only
- **E.** The display name and user principal name of each user only

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To perform a bulk delete of users in Azure Active Directory, you must create and upload a CSV file that includes the user principal name (UPN) of each user. The UPN uniquely identifies each user in Azure AD and is the primary attribute required for user account management operations, including deletions. Thus, including only the UPN in the file is sufficient for bulk deletion purposes.

You assign an Azure policy that has the following settings: Scope: Sub1 Exclusions: Sub1/RG1/VNET1 Policy definition: Append a tag and its value to resources Policy enforcement: Enabled Tag name: Tag4 Tag value: value4 You assign tags to the resources as shown in the following table. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** RG1 has the Tag2:IT tag assigned only -> Yes | Storage1 has the Tag1:subscription, Tag2:IT, Tag3:value1, and Tag4:value4 tags assigned. -> No | VNET1 has the Tag2:IT and Tag3:value2 tags assigned only -> No
> Esibito: q088_pre0.png, q088_pre1.png, q088_pre2.png

**Spiegazione:** Box 1: Yes - The built-in Append a tag and its value to resources definition does not apply to resource groups (there is a separate definition for them), so RG1 keeps only Tag2:IT. Box 2: No - Tags are not inherited from the subscription or the resource group: storage1 has Tag3:value1 plus Tag4:value4, which the policy appends when the resource is updated, but neither Tag1 nor Tag2. Box 3: No - VNET1 is excluded from the assignment, so it receives no Tag4, and it does not inherit Tag2:IT from RG1: it has Tag3:value2 only.

Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution. After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You need to ensure that an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) user named Admin1 is assigned the required role to enable Traffic Analytics for an Azure subscription. Solution: You assign the Traffic Manager Contributor role at the subscription level to Admin1. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Assigning the Traffic Manager Contributor role to Admin1 at the subscription level will not meet the goal of enabling Traffic Analytics for the Azure subscription. The Traffic Manager Contributor role is specifically for managing Traffic Manager profiles and does not provide the necessary permissions to enable Traffic Analytics. Enabling Traffic Analytics requires roles such as Network Contributor or higher, like Owner or Contributor, at the subscription level. Therefore, the correct answer is No.

You have three offices and an Azure subscription that contains an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant. You need to grant user management permissions to a local administrator in each office. What should you use?

- **A.** Azure AD roles
- **B.** administrative units **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** access packages in Azure AD entitlement management
- **D.** Azure roles

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To grant user management permissions to a local administrator in each office, administrative units are the ideal choice. Administrative units in Azure AD allow for the delegation of administrative permissions to specific groups of users or administrators based on organizational structure or location. This provides a more granular and decentralized approach to user management, ensuring that local administrators can manage users and resources within their respective offices without having broader administrative rights across the entire Azure AD tenant. Other options like Azure AD roles or Azure roles are more suitable for broader permissions and may not offer the necessary granularity needed for managing users based on their office locations.

Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** Assigning the Logic App Contributor role to the Developers group on the Dev resource group will meet the goal of providing the Developers group with the ability to create Azure logic apps in the Dev resource group. The Logic App Contributor role grants users the permissions necessary to create, update, and delete logic apps, as well as managing related resources within the scope of the resource group. This ensures that members of the Developers group can work within the Dev resource group to create and manage logic apps without needing broader permissions within the subscription.

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1 that contains a virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 is in a resource group named RG1. Subscription1 has a user named User1. User1 has the following roles:

Reader
Security Admin
Security Reader

You need to ensure that User1 can assign the Reader role for VNet1 to other users. What should you do?

- **A.** Remove User1 from the Security Reader role for Subscription1. Assign User1 the Contributor role for RG1.
- **B.** Assign User1 the Owner role for VNet1. **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Assign User1 the Contributor role for VNet1.
- **D.** Assign User1 the Network Contributor role for VNet1.

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that User1 can assign the Reader role for VNet1 to other users, User1 needs to have the Owner role for VNet1. The Owner role grants full access to manage all resources, including the ability to assign roles in Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Without the Owner role or the User Access Administrator role, User1 will not have the necessary permissions to assign roles to other users. Therefore, assigning User1 the Owner role for VNet1 is the correct action to fulfill the requirement.

> Immagini: q094_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Signing in to a virtual machine with Azure AD credentials is a data-plane operation (Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/login/action), so it belongs in the dataActions section; actions only covers management-plane operations. Where a role can be assigned is controlled by assignableScopes: setting it to the resource group's ID (/subscriptions/<id>/resourceGroups/RG1) makes role1 assignable to RG1 only.

- **B.** Grant share-level permissions by using File Explorer.
- **C.** Mount share1 by using File Explorer.
- **D.** Create a private endpoint.

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To grant the Storage File Data SMB Share Elevated Contributor role, the first step is to enable Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS) authentication for the storage account. This integration allows Azure AD identities, such as security groups, to manage access to Azure file shares. Once AD DS authentication is enabled, you can then assign the appropriate roles to the security group to manage permissions on the file share.

You have 15 Azure subscriptions. You have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant that contains a security group named Group1. You plan to purchase additional Azure subscription. You need to ensure that Group1 can manage role assignments for the existing subscriptions and the planned subscriptions. The solution must meet the following requirements: Use the principle of least privilege. Minimize administrative effort. What should you do?

- **A.** Assign Group1 the Owner role for the root management group.
- **B.** Assign Group1 the User Access Administrator role for the root management group. **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Create a new management group and assign Group1 the User Access Administrator role for the group.
- **D.** Create a new management group and assign Group1 the Owner role for the group.

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that Group1 can manage role assignments for all existing and planned subscriptions while adhering to the principle of least privilege and minimizing administrative effort, you should assign Group1 the User Access Administrator role for the root management group. The User Access Administrator role allows group members to manage user access to Azure resources, which includes managing role assignments. Assigning this role at the root management group level ensures that these permissions apply to all subscriptions under that root, both current and future, without providing broader management permissions that come with the Owner role.

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q098_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** When a new Azure Active Directory tenant is created, the user who creates it is automatically assigned the Global Administrator role for that tenant. In this scenario, User1 created the new tenant named external.contoso.onmicrosoft.com, so User1 becomes the Global Administrator of that tenant. Therefore, User2, even though they are a Global Administrator in the original tenant (contoso.onmicrosoft.com), does not automatically have any role or permissions in the new tenant (external.contoso.onmicrosoft.com). Without being explicitly granted permissions in the new tenant by User1, User2 cannot create new user accounts there. Hence, the solution does not meet the goal.

**Spiegazione:** In the scenario where a new Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant is created, the default global administrator role belongs to the user who created the tenant, which in this case is User1. User3, being a user administrator in the original tenant, does not have any roles or permissions in the new tenant (external.contoso.onmicrosoft.com) by default. Thus, User3 cannot create user accounts in the new tenant unless User1 explicitly grants User3 the necessary permissions in that tenant.

- **A.** Assign the Owner role to the developers
- **B.** Configure app-level credentials for FTPS
- **C.** Assign the Website Contributor role to the developers **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Configure user-level credentials for FTPS

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that developers can deploy content to App1 using their Azure AD credentials, the permission granted should follow the principle of least privilege. The Website Contributor role is the most appropriate as it allows developers to manage website deployments without granting excessive permissions such as those provided by the Owner role. App-level or user-level FTPS credentials are not relevant to this scenario as they do not involve Azure AD credentials and do not adhere to the principle of least privilege. Therefore, assigning the Website Contributor role to the developers meets the requirements effectively.

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** The solution of using the Bulk invite users operation in Azure AD does not meet the goal because the CSV file only contains the names and email addresses of the 500 external users. To successfully use the Bulk invite users operation, the CSV file must also include a redirection URL, which is a required field along with the email address for inviting users.

*Tipo: drag_and_drop · fonte: manual_vision*

You have an Azure subscription named Sub1 that contains two users named User1 and User2. You need to assign role-based access control (RBAC) roles to User1 and User2. The users must be able to perform the following tasks in Sub1:

User1 must view the data in any storage account.
User2 must assign users the Contributor role for storage accounts.

The solution must use the principle of least privilege. Which RBAC role should you assign to each user? To answer, drag the appropriate roles to the correct users. Each role may be used once, more than once, or not at all. You may need to drag the split bar between panes or scroll to view content. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** User1 -> Reader and Data Access | User2 -> Owner
> Immagini: q107_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** User1 must read the data in the storage accounts: Reader and Data Access gives read access to the account plus the permission to list its access keys, so the data can be viewed, without allowing any change - the least privilege among the options. User2 must assign the Contributor role to others, which requires Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write: among the listed roles only Owner includes it (Contributor and Storage Account Contributor explicitly exclude Microsoft.Authorization).

You have an Azure subscription that contains 10 virtual machines, a key vault named Vault1, and a network security group (NSG) named NSG1. All the resources are deployed to the East US Azure region. The virtual machines are protected by using NSG1. NSG1 is configured to block all outbound traffic to the internet. You need to ensure that the virtual machines can access Vault1. The solution must use the principle of least privilege and minimize administrative effort What should you configure as the destination of the outbound security rule for NSG1?

- **A.** an application security group
- **B.** a service tag **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** an IP address range

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that the virtual machines can access Vault1 while minimizing administrative effort and adhering to the principle of least privilege, you should configure a service tag as the destination of the outbound security rule for NSG1. Service tags in Azure simplify network security rule management by grouping IP addresses associated with Azure services, such as Azure Key Vault, under a single tag like 'AzureKeyVault'. This approach allows NSG1 to grant VMs precise access to Vault1 without requiring manual IP address management, thereby reducing administrative complexity and enhancing security.

You have an Azure AD tenant named adatum.com that contains the groups shown in the following table. Adatum.com contains the users shown in the following table. You assign the Azure Active Directory Premium Plan 2 license to Group1 and User4. Which users are assigned the Azure Active Directory Premium Plan 2 license?

- **A.** User4 only
- **B.** User1 and User4 only **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** User1, User2, and User4 only
- **D.** User1, User2, User3, and User4

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q109_pre0.png, q109_pre1.png

**Spiegazione:** In this scenario, User1 and User4 are assigned the Azure Active Directory Premium Plan 2 license. User1 receives the license through their membership in Group1, which has the license assigned directly. User4 receives the license directly assigned to them. According to Azure AD's group-based licensing, the licenses do not propagate to nested groups. Therefore, User2 and User3 do not receive the license because Group2 and Group3 are nested members of Group1. Only the immediate first- level user members of Group1, which includes User1, will receive the license.

You have an Azure AD tenant named contoso.com. You have two external partner organizations named fabrikam.com and litwareinc.com. Fabrikam.com is configured as a connected organization. You create an access package as shown in the Access package exhibit. (Click the Access package tab.) You configure the external user lifecycle settings as shown in the Lifecycle exhibit. (Click the Lifecycle tab.) For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Litwareinc.com users can be assigned to package1. -> No | After 365 days, fabrikam.com users will be removed from Group1. -> Yes | After 395 days, fabrikam.com users will be removed from the contoso.com tenant. -> Yes
> Immagini: q110_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** package1 accepts requests only from all configured connected organizations: fabrikam.com is one, litwareinc.com is not, so litwareinc.com users cannot be assigned to it. Assignments expire after 365 days, and when the assignment ends the user loses the package's resource roles, so fabrikam.com users are removed from Group1. The external user lifecycle settings then block the user from signing in and remove the account 30 days later: 365 + 30 = 395 days after the assignment, fabrikam.com users are removed from the contoso.com tenant.

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1 that contains a virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 is in a resource group named RG1. Subscription1 has a user named User1. User1 has the following roles:

Reader
Security Admin
Security Reader

You need to ensure that User1 can assign the Reader role for VNet1 to other users. What should you do?

- **A.** Assign User1 the Network Contributor role for VNet1.
- **B.** Remove User1 from the Security Reader role for Subscription1. Assign User1 the Contributor role for RG1.
- **C.** Assign User1 the Owner role for VNet1. **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Assign User1 the Network Contributor role for RG1.

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that User1 can assign the Reader role for VNet1 to other users, the appropriate action is to assign User1 the Owner role for VNet1. The Owner role has the necessary permissions to manage all aspects of the resource, including assigning roles to other users. Other roles mentioned, such as Network Contributor, do not have the permission to assign roles to others. Removing User1 from the Security Reader role and assigning the Contributor role for RG1 does not provide the specific necessary permissions for assigning roles within VNet1.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the users shown in the following table. The groups are configured as shown in the following table. You have a resource group named RG1 as shown in the following exhibit. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** You can assign User2 the Owner role for RG1 by adding Group2 as a member of Group1. -> No | You can assign User3 the Owner role for RG1 by adding Group3 as a member of Group1. -> No | You can assign User3 the Owner role for RG1 by assigning the Owner role to Group3 for RG1. -> Yes
> Immagini: q112_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Group1 is assigned the Owner role on RG1, but it is a role-assignable group (Azure AD roles can be assigned to it), and role-assignable groups cannot contain other groups: neither Group2 nor Group3 can be added as a member of Group1, so nesting cannot give User2 or User3 the Owner role. Assigning the Owner role directly to Group3 for RG1 works: User3, a member of Group3, inherits it.

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1 that contains a virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 is in a resource group named RG1. Subscription1 has a user named User1. User1 has the following roles:

Reader
Security Admin
Security Reader

You need to ensure that User1 can assign the Reader role for VNet1 to other users. What should you do?

- **A.** Remove User1 from the Security Reader role for Subscript on 1. Assign User1 the Contributor role for RG1.
- **B.** Assign User1 the Owner role for VNet1. **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Remove User1 from the Security Reader and Reader roles for Subscription1. Assign User1 the Contributor role for Subscription 1.
- **D.** Assign User1 the Contributor role for VNet1.

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To ensure User1 can assign the Reader role for VNet1 to other users, User1 needs a role that includes the permission to manage role assignments. The Owner role is the appropriate choice because it grants full access to manage all resources, including the ability to assign roles in Azure RBAC. The other roles such as Reader, Security Admin, Security Reader, and Contributor do not provide the permissions necessary to assign roles.

Your on-premises network contains a VPN gateway. You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources shown in the following table. You need to ensure that all the traffic from VM1 to storage1 travels across the Microsoft backbone network. What should you configure?

- **A.** Azure Application Gateway
- **B.** private endpoints **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** a network security group (NSG)
- **D.** Azure Virtual WAN

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q114_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that all traffic from VM1 to storage1 travels across the Microsoft backbone network, you should configure private endpoints. Private endpoints allow clients on a virtual network (VNet) to securely access data over a Private Link. The private endpoint uses a separate IP address from the VNet address space for each storage account service. This ensures that network traffic between the clients on the VNet and the storage account traverses over the VNet and a private link on the Microsoft backbone network, eliminating exposure from the public Internet. This configuration increases security and reliability.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a user named User1 and the resources shown in the following table. NSG1 is associated to networkinterface1. User1 has role assignments for NSG1 as shown in the following table. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** User1 can create a storage account in RG1. -> Yes | User1 can modify the DNS settings of networkinterface1. -> No | User1 can create an inbound security rule to filter inbound traffic to networkinterface1. -> Yes
> Immagini: q115_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** User1 has Contributor on NSG1 only, Reader on the subscription and Storage Account Contributor inherited from the resource group. Storage Account Contributor on RG1 is enough to create a storage account there. On networkinterface1 User1 only has Reader, inherited from the subscription, so its DNS settings cannot be changed. Contributor on NSG1 lets User1 add security rules to the NSG, and since NSG1 is associated to networkinterface1 a new inbound rule filters traffic to that interface.

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1 that contains a virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 is in a resource group named RG1. Subscription1 has a user named User1. User1 has the following roles:

Reader
Security Admin
Security Reader

You need to ensure that User1 can assign the Reader role for VNet1 to other users. What should you do?

- **A.** Remove User1 from the Security Reader role for Subscription1. Assign User1 the Contributor role for RG1.
- **B.** Assign User1 the Access Administrator role for VNet1. **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Remove User1 from the Security Reader and Reader roles for Subscription1. Assign User1 the Contributor role for Subscription1.
- **D.** Assign User1 the Network Contributor role for RG1.

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To allow User1 to assign the Reader role for VNet1 to other users, User1 must have the necessary permissions to manage access to the virtual network. The role that specifically grants the ability to assign roles to users is the Access Administrator role. This role provides the 'Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write' permission, which is required to add and remove role assignments. Therefore, assigning User1 the Access Administrator role for VNet1 will enable them to assign the Reader role to other users.

You have three Azure subscriptions named Sub1, Sub2, and Sub3 that are linked to an Azure AD tenant. The tenant contains a user named User1, a security group named Group1, and a management group named MG1. User1 is a member of Group1. Sub1 and Sub2 are members of MG1. Sub1 contains a resource group named RG1. RG1 contains five Azure functions. You create the following role assignments for MG1:

Group1: Reader
User1: User Access Administrator

You assign User1 the Virtual Machine Contributor role for Sub1 and Sub2.

**Risposta corretta:** The Group1 members can view the configurations of the Azure functions. -> Yes | User1 can assign the Owner role for RG1. -> Yes | User1 can create a new resource group and deploy a virtual machine to the new group. -> No
> Immagini: q117_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Group1 has the Reader role on MG1, inherited by Sub1 and everything in it, so its members can view the configuration of the functions in RG1. User1 has User Access Administrator on MG1, which lets User1 manage role assignments - Owner included - for any scope below MG1, such as RG1. Virtual Machine Contributor, assigned to User1 on Sub1 and Sub2, allows managing virtual machines but not creating resource groups (Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resourceGroups/write), so User1 cannot create a new resource group.

- **A.** Enable identity-based data access for the file shares in storage1. **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Modify the security profile for the file shares in storage1.
- **C.** Select Default to Azure Active Directory authorization in the Azure portal for storage1.
- **D.** Configure Access control (IAM) for share1.

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q118_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To allocate the Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor role to User1 for share1, the initial step is to authorize identity-based data access for the file shares in storage1. This action guarantees that individual user access is properly authenticated, adhering to Azure's security protocols. Subsequent to this, you can proceed to configure Access control (IAM) to assign the specific role to User1.

- **C.** Remove User1 from the Security Reader and Reader roles for Subscription1.
- **D.** Assign User1 the Contributor role for VNet1.

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that User1 can assign the Reader role for VNet1 to other users, User1 needs to have the User Access Administrator role for VNet1. This role allows a user to manage user access to Azure resources, providing the necessary permissions to assign roles like Reader to other users.

You have an Azure AD tenant named adatum.com that contains the groups shown in the following table. Adatum.com contains the users shown in the following table. You assign an Azure Active Directory Premium P2 license to Group1 as shown in the following exhibit. Group2 is NOT directly assigned a license. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** You can assign User1 the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Discovery license. -> Yes | You can remove the Azure Active Directory Premium P2 license from User1. -> No | User2 is assigned the Azure Active Directory Premium P2. -> No
> Immagini: q120_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** The P2 license is assigned to Group1 with the Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps Discovery service plan turned off. User1 can still receive that plan through a direct assignment, so it can be assigned. A license inherited from a group cannot be removed from the single user - you have to remove the user from the group or change the group assignment. Group-based licensing does not apply to nested groups, so User2, a member of Group2 (itself a member of Group1), does not get the P2 license.

You have a hybrid deployment of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that contains the users shown in the following table. You need to modify the JobTitle and UsageLocation attributes for the users. For which users can you modify the attributes from Azure AD? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** JobTitle -> User1 and User3 only | UsageLocation -> User1, User2, and User3

**Spiegazione:** Identity, contact and job information - JobTitle included - can be edited in Azure AD only for users whose source of authority is Azure AD: User1 (cloud member) and User3 (guest). User2 is synced from on-premises Active Directory, so its job title must be changed in AD DS and synced. UsageLocation is an Azure AD-only attribute, not synchronized from on-premises, so it can be set for all three users.

Solution: You create a PowerShell script that runs the New-MgUser cmdlet for each external user. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** The New-MgUser cmdlet is used to create new users in Azure AD. However, for creating guest users (external users), the appropriate approach is to invite them using the New-AzureADMSInvitation cmdlet or a similar command in the Microsoft Graph module. Therefore, creating guest user accounts using New-MgUser does not meet the goal.

Solution: You create a PowerShell script that runs the New-MgInvitation cmdlet for each external user. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** Using a PowerShell script with the New-MgInvitation cmdlet for each external user listed in the CSV file will effectively create a guest user account in the Azure AD tenant for each of the 500 external users. The New-MgInvitation cmdlet sends an invitation email to each external user, and when the user accepts the invitation, their guest account is created in the directory. This approach is a valid method to achieve the goal of creating guest user accounts in contoso.com for the 500 external users.

You have a condition named Condition2 as shown in the following exhibit. You assign roles to User1 and User2 as shown in the following table. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** User1 can read blob2. -> No | User1 can read blob3. -> No | User2 can read blob1. -> Yes
> Immagini: q133_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Condition1 limits User1's Storage Blob Data Reader role: a blob read is allowed only when the container name equals cont1, so User1 can read blob1 but neither blob2 (cont2) nor blob3 (cont3). Condition2 restricts only write operations of User2's Storage Blob Data Owner role (allowed only on paths containing 2); reads are not affected, and the role is scoped to storage1, so User2 can read blob1.

Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution. After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named contoso.com. You have a CSV file that contains the names and email addresses of 500 external users. You need to create a guest user account in contoso.com for each of the 500 external users. Solution: You create a PowerShell script that runs the New-MgUser cmdlet for each user. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To create a guest user account for external users in Azure AD, you should use the 'New-MgInvitation' cmdlet. This cmdlet is specifically designed to invite external users to your directory by sending them an invitation. The 'New-MgUser' cmdlet, on the other hand, is used for creating regular user accounts within the directory, not guest accounts. Therefore, the solution provided does not meet the goal.

You purchase a new Azure subscription. You create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template named deploy.json as shown in the following exhibit. You connect to the subscription and run the following command. `New-AzDeployment -Location westus -TemplateFile "deploy.json"` For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Three resource groups are created when you run the script. -> No | A resource group named RGroup5 is created. -> No | All the resource groups are created in the East US Azure region. -> Yes
> Immagini: q135_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** The subscription-level deployment creates four resource groups, not three: the copy loop with count 2 creates RGS0 and RGS1, then ResGrp8, and finally RGroup plus length(parameters('obj1')) - obj1 has four properties (propA to propD), so the group is RGroup4, not RGroup5. Every location resolves to East US: the copy loop uses eastus, last(variables('var1')) is eastus, and par1 defaults to eastus.

Your on-premises network contains a VPN gateway. You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources shown in the following table. You need to ensure that all the traffic from VM1 to storage1 travels across the Microsoft backbone network. What should you configure?

- **A.** Azure AD Application Proxy
- **B.** private endpoints **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** a network security group (NSG)
- **D.** Azure Peering Service

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q136_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that all the traffic from VM1 to storage1 travels across the Microsoft backbone network, you should configure private endpoints. A private endpoint is a network interface that uses a private IP address from your virtual network. This network interface connects you privately and securely to a service that is powered by Azure Private Link. By enabling a private endpoint, traffic between VM1 and storage1 will traverse the Microsoft backbone network, avoiding the public internet.

Your on-premises network contains a VPN gateway. You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources shown in the following table. You need to ensure that all the traffic from VM1 to storage1 travels across the Microsoft backbone network. What should you configure?

- **A.** Azure AD Application Proxy
- **B.** service endpoints **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** a network security group (NSG)
- **D.** Azure Firewall

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q137_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that all the traffic from VM1 to storage1 travels across the Microsoft backbone network, you need to configure service endpoints. Service endpoints provide secure and direct connectivity to Azure services by extending the VNet private IP address space to those services. This ensures that traffic between the VM and the storage account remains on the Azure network, avoiding any potential exposure to the public internet.

Your on-premises network contains a VPN gateway. You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources shown in the following table. You need to ensure that all the traffic from VM1 to storage1 travels across the Microsoft backbone network. What should you configure?

- **A.** Azure Application Gateway
- **B.** service endpoints **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** a network security group (NSG)
- **D.** Azure Peering Service

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q138_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that all traffic from VM1 to storage1 travels across the Microsoft backbone network, you should configure service endpoints. Service endpoints provide direct connectivity to Azure services over an optimized route on the Azure backbone network. This setup ensures that traffic between your virtual network (VNet1) and the Azure Storage account (storage1) does not traverse the public internet, but rather stays within the Microsoft network, thus providing better security and performance.

You have an Azure subscription named Sub1 that contains the resources shown in the following table. You create a user named Admin1. To what can you add Admin1 as a co-administrator?

- **A.** RG1
- **B.** MG1
- **C.** Sub1 **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** VM1

**Risposta corretta:** C
> Esibito: q139_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** Admin1 can be added as a co-administrator to Sub1, the subscription. Co-administrators have full access to all resources within a subscription, including the capabilities to create, read, update, and delete resources. This role can only be assigned at the subscription level and not at the level of management groups, resource groups, or virtual machines.

You have a Microsoft Entra tenant that contains the groups shown in the following table. The tenant contains the users shown in the following table. Which users and groups can you delete? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. Note: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Users -> User1, User2, User3, and User4 | Groups -> Group2 and Group4 only
> Immagini: q140_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Licenses never block the deletion of a user, whether assigned directly or through a group, so all four users can be deleted. A group cannot be deleted while it has licenses assigned to it - you must remove the license assignment first - so only Group2 and Group4, which have no assigned licenses, can be deleted.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources shown in the following table. You need to ensure that data transfers between storage1 and VM1 do NOT traverse the internet What should you configure for storage1?

- **A.** data protection
- **B.** a private endpoint **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Public network access in the Firewalls and virtual networks settings
- **D.** a shared access signature (SAS)

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q141_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that data transfers between storage1 and VM1 do not traverse the internet, you should configure a private endpoint for storage1. A private endpoint provides a private IP address in your virtual network, enabling you to securely connect to the storage account using this private IP. This ensures that the traffic stays within the Azure backbone network, thereby avoiding the public internet entirely.

You have a Microsoft Entra tenant that is linked to the subscriptions shown in the following table. You have the resource groups shown in the following table. You assign roles to users as shown in the following table. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** User1 can resize VM1. -> Yes | User2 can create a new storage account in RG1. -> No | User3 can assign User1 the Owner role for RG3. -> Yes
> Immagini: q142_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** User1 is Contributor on MG2, which contains Sub3 and therefore RG3 and VM1, so User1 can resize VM1. User2 has Storage Account Contributor only on storage1: the role is scoped to that single account and does not allow creating new storage accounts in RG1. User3 is User Access Administrator at the Tenant Root Group, inherited by every subscription and resource group, so User3 can assign User1 the Owner role for RG3.

- **A.** a network security group (NSG)
- **B.** private endpoints **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Microsoft Entra Application Proxy
- **D.** Azure Virtual WAN

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q143_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** A private endpoint gives storage1 a private IP address inside the virtual network of VM1, through Azure Private Link: traffic from VM1 to storage1 then stays on the Microsoft backbone and never crosses the internet. An NSG only filters traffic, Microsoft Entra Application Proxy publishes on-premises web apps, and Azure Virtual WAN connects branches and networks, not a VM to a PaaS service.

You have a Microsoft Entra tenant. You plan to perform a bulk import of users. You need to ensure that imported user objects are added automatically as the members of a specific group based on each user's department. The solution must minimize administrative effort. Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- **A.** Create groups that use the Assigned membership type.
- **B.** Create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template.

- **E.** Create an XML file that contains user information and the appropriate attributes.
- **F.** Create a CSV file that contains user information and the appropriate attributes. **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** C, F

**Spiegazione:** Bulk create in the Microsoft Entra admin center imports users from a CSV file that you download as a template and fill in with the user attributes, department included. Groups with the Dynamic User membership type and a rule on user.department then add each imported user to the right group automatically, with no further work; assigned groups, a PowerShell parser or an ARM template would all require extra effort.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named storage1. You need to ensure that the access keys for storage1 rotate automatically. What should you configure?

- **A.** a backup vault
- **B.** redundancy for storage1
- **C.** lifecycle management for storage1
- **D.** an Azure key vault **← CORRETTA**
- **E.** a Recovery Services vault

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** Azure Key Vault can manage the access keys of a storage account: once the account is added to the vault as a managed storage account, Key Vault regenerates its keys on a defined schedule (for example every 90 days), so they rotate automatically. Lifecycle management moves or deletes blobs, redundancy and backup or Recovery Services vaults protect data, and none of them touch the account keys.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the Microsoft Entra identities shown in the following table. You need to enable self-service password reset (SSPR). For which identities can you enable SSPR in the Azure portal?

- **A.** User1 only
- **B.** Group1 only
- **C.** User1 and Group1 only
- **D.** Group1 and Group2 only **← CORRETTA**
- **E.** User1, Group1, and Group2

**Risposta corretta:** D
> Esibito: q146_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** Self-service password reset is enabled tenant-wide either for All users or for Selected groups - there is no option to target a single user directly. In the Selected scope you can choose groups, both security groups and Microsoft 365 groups, so SSPR can be enabled for Group1 and Group2; User1 gets it only by being a member of one of those groups.

You have a Microsoft Entra tenant. You need to ensure that when a new Microsoft 365 group is created, the group name is automatically formatted as follows: Which three actions should you perform in sequence in the Microsoft Entra admin center? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

**Risposta corretta:** 1. Create a group naming policy. -> 2. Set Add prefix to Attribute. -> 3. Set Select type to Department.
> Immagini: q147_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** The format <Department><Group name> puts a value taken from the user's profile before the group name. In the Microsoft Entra admin center you create a group naming policy, add a prefix of type Attribute (rather than a fixed String) and select the Department attribute. The policy applies to Microsoft 365 groups created afterwards; company branding has nothing to do with group names.

**Risposta corretta:** Users -> User1, User2, User3, and User4 | Groups -> Group1 and Group3 only
> Immagini: q148_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** A license, whether assigned directly or inherited from a group, never prevents deleting a user, so all four users can be deleted. A group with a license assigned to it cannot be deleted until the license assignment is removed: Group2 and Group4 have Microsoft Entra ID P2 assigned, so only Group1 and Group3 can be deleted.

What should you create for app1 to access the key vault, and from which key vault can the secret be used? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Create a -> Managed identity | Use the secret from -> Vault1, Vault2, or Vault3
> Immagini: q149_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** app1 should authenticate to Key Vault with a managed identity: Azure manages the credentials, so no secret has to be stored in the app, and the identity is then granted access to the secrets (Key Vault Secrets User role or an access policy). A key vault can be reached by any identity in the same Microsoft Entra tenant, whatever its resource group or region, so app1 can use the secret from Vault1, Vault2 or Vault3.

You have a Microsoft Entra tenant named contoso.com. You collaborate with an external partner named fabrikam.com. You plan to invite users in fabrikam.com to the contoso.com tenant. You need to ensure that invitations can be sent only to fabrikam.com users. What should you do in the Microsoft Entra admin center?

- **A.** From Cross-tenant access settings, configure the Tenant restrictions settings.
- **B.** From Cross-tenant access settings, configure the Microsoft cloud settings.
- **C.** From External collaboration settings, configure the Guest user access restrictions settings.
- **D.** From External collaboration settings, configure the Collaboration restrictions settings. **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** Collaboration restrictions, in External collaboration settings, decide which domains can be invited: setting it to Allow invitations only to the specified domains (most restrictive) and listing fabrikam.com limits B2B invitations to that partner. Tenant restrictions control which external tenants your own users can sign in to, Microsoft cloud settings govern collaboration with other Microsoft clouds, and guest user access restrictions decide what guests can see in the directory.

- **F.** Storage Blob Delegator

**Risposta corretta:** D, E

**Spiegazione:** Azure ABAC role assignment conditions are supported on the storage data roles for blobs and queues, such as Storage Blob Data Reader, Storage Blob Data Contributor and Storage Blob Data Owner: they are the roles that grant access to the blob data and can carry a condition. Owner and Storage Account Contributor are management-plane roles, Storage Account Backup Contributor serves Azure Backup, and Storage Blob Delegator only allows getting a user delegation key.

Overview

ADatum Corporation is consulting firm that has a main office in Montreal and branch offices in Seattle and New York.

Existing Environment

Azure Environment

ADatum has an Azure subscription that contains three resource groups named RG1, RG2, and RG3. The subscription contains the storage accounts shown in the following table. The subscription contains the virtual machines shown in the following table. The subscription has an Azure container registry that contains the images shown in the following table. The subscription contains the resources shown in the following table.

Azure Key Vault

The subscription contains an Azure key vault named Vault1. Vault1 contains the certificates shown in the following table. Vault1 contains the keys shown in the following table.

Microsoft Entra Environment

ADatum has a Microsoft Entra tenant named adatum.com that is linked to the Azure subscription and contains the users shown in the following table. The tenant contains the groups shown in the following table. The adatum.com tenant has a custom security attribute named Attribute1.

Planned Changes

ADatum plans to implement the following changes:

Configure a data collection rule (DCR) named DCR1 to collect only system events that have an event ID of 4648 from VM2 and VM4.
In storage1, create a new container named cont2 that has the following access policies:
  Three stored access policies named Stored1, Stored2, and Stored3
  A legal hold for immutable blob storage
Whenever possible, use directories to organize storage account content.
Grant User1 the permissions required to link Zone1 to VNet1.
Assign Attribute1 to supported adatum.com resources.
In storage2, create an encryption scope named Scope1.
Deploy new containers by using Image1 or Image2.

Technical Requirements

ADatum must meet the following technical requirements:

Use TLS for WebApp1.
Follow the principle of LEAST privilege.
Grant permissions at the required scope ONLY.
Ensure that Scope1 is used to encrypt storage services.
Use Azure Backup to back up cont1 and share1 as frequently as possible.
Whenever possible, use Azure Disk Encryption and a key encryption key (KEK) to encrypt the virtual machines.

You need to implement the planned change for Attribute1. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Admin1 can assign Attribute1 to Group1. -> No | Admin2 can assign Attribute1 to User1. -> No | Admin3 can assign Attribute1 to Group2. -> No
> Immagini: q152_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Custom security attributes can be assigned to users and to enterprise applications (service principals), not to groups, so Attribute1 can never be assigned to Group1 or Group2, whatever the role. Assigning attributes requires the Attribute Assignment Administrator role: Admin1 is a Global Administrator, but that role does not include custom security attribute permissions by default, and Admin2's Attribute Definition Administrator only defines attributes, it cannot assign them.

You have a Microsoft Entra tenant configured as shown in the following exhibit. The tenant contains the identities shown in the following table. You purchase a Microsoft Fabric license. To which identities can you assign the license?

- **A.** User1 only **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** User1 and Group1 only
- **C.** User1 and Group2 only
- **D.** User1, Group1, and Group2

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q153_pre0.png, q153_pre1.png

**Spiegazione:** The tenant runs Microsoft Entra ID Free, and group-based licensing requires a paid plan such as Microsoft Entra ID P1 (or a product that includes it). Without it, licenses can only be assigned directly to users, so the Microsoft Fabric license can be assigned to User1 but neither to Group1 nor to Group2.

*Tipo: multiple_choice · fonte: text_layer*

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named storage. The storage account contains a blob that stores images. Client access to storage1 is granted by using a shared access signature (SAS). You need to ensure that users receive a warning message when they generate a SAS that exceeds a seven-day time period. What should you do for storage?

- **A.** Enable a read-only lock.
- **B.** Configure an alert rule.
- **C.** Add a lifecycle management rule.
- **D.** Set Allow recommended upper limit for shared access signature (SAS) expiry interval to Enabled. **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** A SAS expiration policy sets a recommended upper limit for the validity interval of shared access signatures on the storage account. Once it is enabled, generating a SAS whose interval exceeds the limit - here seven days - produces a warning (the request is still allowed, but it is logged), which is exactly what is required. Locks, alert rules and lifecycle management rules have nothing to do with SAS validity. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/sas-expiration-policy

You have Azure subscription that includes data in following locations: You plan to export data by using Azure import/export job named Export1. You need to identify the data that can be exported by using Export1. Which data should you identify?

- **A.** DB1
- **B.** container1 **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** share1
- **D.** Table1

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q157_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** Azure Import/Export service supports exporting data from Azure Blob Storage, which includes Block blobs, Page blobs, and Append blobs. Given the available options, container1, which is a Blob container, matches the criteria for data that can be exported using the Azure Import/Export job named Export1. Other types such as Azure files share, SQL database, and Azure Table are not supported for export using this service.

You have an Azure Storage account named storage1. You have an Azure App Service app named App1 and an app named App2 that runs in an Azure container instance. Each app uses a managed identity. You need to ensure that App1 and App2 can read blobs from storage1. The solution must meet the following requirements: Minimize the number of secrets used. Ensure that App2 can only read from storage1 for the next 30 days. What should you configure in storage1 for each app? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** App1 -> Access control (IAM) | App2 -> Shared access signatures (SAS)
> Immagini: q158_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** App1 runs with a managed identity, so in Access control (IAM) you grant that identity a data role such as Storage Blob Data Reader: no secret is involved at all. App2 must read for the next 30 days only: a shared access signature with read permission and an expiry 30 days out grants time-limited access that stops on its own. Access keys give full, permanent access to the account and are themselves secrets to protect. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview

You need to create an Azure Storage account that meets the following requirements:

Minimizes costs
Supports hot, cool, and archive blob tiers
Provides fault tolerance if a disaster affects the Azure region where the account resides

How should you complete the command? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Spiegazione:** Box 1: StorageV2 - You may only tier your object storage data to hot, cool, or archive in Blob storage and General Purpose v2 (GPv2) accounts. General Purpose v1 (GPv1) accounts do not support tiering. General-purpose v2 accounts deliver the lowest per-gigabyte capacity prices for Azure Storage, as well as industry-competitive transaction prices. Box 2: Standard_GRS - Geo-redundant storage (GRS): Cross-regional replication to protect against region-wide unavailability. Incorrect Answers: Locally-redundant storage (LRS): A simple, low-cost replication strategy. Data is replicated within a single storage scale unit. Read-access geo-redundant storage (RA-GRS): Cross-regional replication with read access to the replica. RA-GRS provides read-only access to the data in the secondary location, in addition to geo- replication across two regions, but is more expensive compared to GRS.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources in the following table. Store1 contains a file share named data. Data contains 5,000 files. You need to synchronize the files in the file share named data to an on-premises server named Server1. Which three actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- **A.** Create a container instance
- **B.** Register Server1 **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1 **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Download an automation script
- **E.** Create a sync group **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B, C, E
> Esibito: q160_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To synchronize the files in an Azure file share named data with an on-premises server named Server1, the following steps are necessary: Firstly, install the Azure File Sync agent on Server1 to enable it to sync with the Azure file share. Secondly, register Server1 with the Storage Sync Service to establish a trust relationship between Server1 and Azure. Finally, create a sync group that includes the cloud endpoint (the Azure file share) and the server endpoint (a path on Server1). This setup will ensure the files are synchronized between the Azure and on-premises environments.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources shown in the following table. The status of VM1 is Running. You assign an Azure policy as shown in the exhibit. (Click the Exhibit tab.) You assign the policy by using the following parameters:

Microsoft.ClassicNetwork/virtualNetworks
Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks
Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** An administrator can move VNET1 to RG2 -> Yes | The state of VM1 changed to deallocated -> No | An administrator can modify the address space of VNET2 -> No
> Immagini: q161_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** The Not allowed resource types policy is assigned to RG2 and blocks virtual networks (classic and ARM) and virtual machines. Moving VNET1 from RG1 to RG2 is a move operation, which this policy does not evaluate, so the administrator can move it. A policy never stops or deallocates existing resources: VM1 is merely reported as non-compliant and keeps running. Updating a non-compliant resource, such as changing the address space of VNET2, is a write request that the deny effect blocks.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account. You have an on-premises server named Server1 that runs Windows Server 2016. Server1 has 2 TB of data. You need to transfer the data to the storage account by using the Azure Import/Export service. In which order should you perform the actions? To answer, move all actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order. NOTE: More than one order of answer choices is correct. You will receive credit for any of the correct orders you select.

**Risposta corretta:** 1. Attach an external disk to Server1 and then run waimportexport.exe -> 2. From the Azure portal, create an import job -> 3. Detach the external disks from Server1 and ship the disks to an Azure data center -> 4. From the Azure portal, update the import job
> Immagini: q162_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** At a high level, an import job involves the following steps: Step 1: Attach an external disk to Server1 and then run waimportexport.exe Determine data to be imported, number of drives you need, destination blob location for your data in Azure storage. Use the WAImportExport tool to copy data to disk drives. Encrypt the disk drives with BitLocker. Step 2: From the Azure portal, create an import job. Create an import job in your target storage account in Azure portal. Upload the drive journal files. Step 3: Detach the external disks from Server1 and ship the disks to an Azure data center. Provide the return address and carrier account number for shipping the drives back to you. Ship the disk drives to the shipping address provided during job creation. Step 4: From the Azure portal, update the import job Update the delivery tracking number in the import job details and submit the import job. The drives are received and processed at the Azure data center. The drives are shipped using your carrier account to the return address provided in the import job.

You have Azure subscription that includes following Azure file shares: You have the following on-premises servers: You create a Storage Sync Service named Sync1 and an Azure File Sync group named Group1. Group1 uses share1 as a cloud endpoint. You register Server1 and Server2 in Sync1. You add D:\Folder1 on Server1 as a server endpoint of Group1. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** share2 can be added as a cloud endpoint for Group1 -> No | E:\Folder2 on Server1 can be added as a server endpoint for Group1 -> No | D:\Data on Server2 can be added as a server endpoint for Group1 -> Yes
> Immagini: q163_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** A sync group has exactly one cloud endpoint: Group1 already uses share1, so share2 cannot be added to it. A registered server can contribute only one server endpoint to a given sync group: Server1 already provides D:\Folder1, so E:\Folder2 cannot be added to Group1 (it could go into another sync group). Server2 is registered in Sync1 and has no endpoint in Group1 yet, so D:\Data can be added. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/file-sync/file-sync-planning

You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure Storage account. You plan to copy an on-premises virtual machine image to a container named vmimages. You need to create the container for the planned image. Which command should you run? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** azcopy [box 1] -> make | 'https://mystorageaccount.[box 2].core.windows.net/vmimages' -> blob
> Nota: Comando: azcopy make 'https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/vmimages'
> Immagini: q165_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** azcopy make creates a container (or a file share) at the URL you pass; sync and copy move data instead. A container for blobs - a VM image is stored as a page blob - lives on the Blob service endpoint, so the URL is https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/vmimages: azcopy make 'https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/vmimages'.

You have an Azure File sync group that has the endpoints shown in the following table. Cloud tiering is enabled for Endpoint3. You add a file named File1 to Endpoint1 and a file named File2 to Endpoint2. On which endpoints will File1 and File2 be available within 24 hours of adding the files? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** File1 -> Endpoint1 only | File2 -> Endpoint1, Endpoint2, and Endpoint3
> Immagini: q166_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Endpoint1 is the cloud endpoint. Azure File Sync does not see changes made directly in the Azure file share right away: a change detection job scans the share only once every 24 hours, so within that window File1 stays on Endpoint1 only. File2 is added to a server endpoint, whose changes are picked up immediately and synced to the cloud endpoint and from there to Endpoint3 (cloud tiering only affects how files are cached locally, not whether they appear).

You have a sync group named Sync1 that has a cloud endpoint. The cloud endpoint includes a file named File1.txt. Your on-premises network contains servers that run Windows Server 2016. The servers are configured as shown in the following table. You add Share1 as an endpoint for Sync1. One hour later, you add Share2 as an endpoint for Sync1. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** On the cloud endpoint, File1.txt is overwritten by File1.txt from Share1. -> No | On Server1, File1.txt is overwritten by File1.txt from the cloud endpoint. -> No | File1.txt from Share1 replicates to Share2. -> Yes
> Immagini: q168_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** When Share1 joins the sync group, File1.txt exists both on the cloud endpoint and on Server1. Azure File Sync never overwrites in a conflict: it keeps both versions and renames one of them by appending the server or cloud name (for example File1-Server1.txt), so neither copy is overwritten. When Share2 is added an hour later, it receives all the files in the namespace, File1.txt from Share1 included.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the storage accounts shown in the following table. You need to identify which storage account can be converted to zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replication by requesting a live migration from Azure support. What should you identify?

- **A.** storage1
- **B.** storage2 **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** storage3
- **D.** storage4

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q169_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** Storage2 is the correct answer because it meets the criteria for conversion to zone-redundant storage (ZRS) through a live migration. To be eligible for live migration to ZRS, the storage account needs to be a General Purpose v2 account with Locally-redundant storage (LRS) replication. Storage2 is a General Purpose v2 account and uses LRS replication, making it eligible for live migration to ZRS. Other options either use unsupported account types or have a different replication that needs manual conversion steps before ZRS migration.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named account1. You plan to upload the disk files of a virtual machine to account1 from your on-premises network. The on-premises network uses a public IP address space of131.107.1.0/24. You plan to use the disk files to provision an Azure virtual machine named VM1. VM1 will be attached to a virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 uses an IP address space of 192.168.0.0/24. You need to configure account1 to meet the following requirements: Ensure that you can upload the disk files to account1. Ensure that you can attach the disks to VM1. Prevent all other access to account1. Which two actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- **A.** From the Networking blade of account1, select Selected networks. **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** From the Networking blade of account1, select Allow trusted Microsoft services to access this storage account.
- **C.** From the Networking blade of account1, add the 131.107.1.0/24 IP address range. **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** From the Networking blade of account1, add VNet1.
- **E.** From the Service endpoints blade of VNet1, add a service endpoint.

**Risposta corretta:** A, C

**Spiegazione:** To meet the requirements of uploading the disk files from the on-premises network and attaching the disks to VM1 while preventing all other access, you should select 'Selected networks' in the Networking blade of account1 to limit access to specified networks or IP addresses. Additionally, you need to add the 131.107.1.0/24 IP address range to allow access from the on-premises network. These steps ensure that the required networks have access, fulfilling both the need to upload from the on-premises IP and attach to VM1, while blocking other traffic.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the storage accounts shown in the following exhibit. Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** You can create a premium file share in -> contoso104 only | You can use the Archive access tier in -> contoso101 or contoso103 only
> Immagini: q186_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Premium file shares exist only in FileStorage accounts, so contoso104 is the only option. The Archive access tier is available in general-purpose v2 (StorageV2) and legacy Blob storage accounts - contoso101 and contoso103 - but not in general-purpose v1 (Storage) accounts like contoso102, nor in FileStorage accounts, which hold no blobs.

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1. In Subscription1, you create an Azure file share named share1. You create a shared access signature (SAS) named SAS1 as shown in the following exhibit: To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** If on September 2, 2018, you run Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer on a computer that has an IP address of 193.77.134.1, and you use SAS1 to connect to the storage account, you [answer choice]. -> will have no access | If on September 10, 2018, you run the net use command on a computer that has an IP address of 193.77.134.50, and you use SAS1 as the password to connect to share1, you [answer choice]. -> will have no access
> Immagini: q187_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** SAS1 is limited to the File service, valid from September 1 to September 14, 2018, and only for IP addresses 193.77.134.10-193.77.134.50. A computer at 193.77.134.1 is outside the allowed range, so Storage Explorer gets no access even within the validity period. net use mounts the share over SMB, which does not accept a SAS token as the password - it needs the storage account key or an identity-based login - so the connection fails and there is no access.

You have two Azure virtual machines named VM1 and VM2. You have two Recovery Services vaults named RSV1 and RSV2. VM2 is backed up to RSV1.You need to back up VM2 to RSV2.What should you do first?

- **A.** From the RSV1 blade, click Backup items and stop the VM2 backup **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** From the RSV2 blade, click Backup. From the Backup blade, select the backup for the virtual machine, and then click Backup
- **C.** From the VM2 blade, click Disaster recovery, click Replication settings, and then select RSV2 as the Recovery Services vault
- **D.** From the RSV1 blade, click Backup Jobs and export the VM2 job

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To back up an Azure virtual machine (VM2) to a different Recovery Services vault (RSV2), you must first stop the existing backup of VM2 in the current Recovery Services vault (RSV1). Virtual machines can only be associated with one vault at a time, and you cannot back up the same VM to two different vaults simultaneously. Therefore, you need to disassociate the VM from the current vault by stopping its backup, after which you can configure and start the backup in the new vault (RSV2).

You have a general-purpose v1 Azure Storage account named storage1 that uses locally-redundant storage (LRS). You need to ensure that the data in the storage account is protected if a zone fails. The solution must minimize costs and administrative effort. What should you do first?

- **A.** Create a new storage account.
- **B.** Configure object replication rules.
- **C.** Upgrade the account to general-purpose v2. **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Modify the Replication setting of storage1.

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To ensure data in the storage account is protected if a zone fails while minimizing costs and administrative effort, the first step should be to upgrade the account to general-purpose v2. Only general-purpose v2 accounts support Zone-Redundant Storage (ZRS), which distributes data across multiple zones to ensure resiliency in case of a zone failure. This upgrade is necessary because general-purpose v1 accounts do not support ZRS.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the storage accounts shown in the following table. You plan to manage the data stored in the accounts by using lifecycle management rules. To which storage accounts can you apply lifecycle management rules?

- **A.** storage1 only
- **B.** storage1 and storage2 only
- **C.** storage3 and storage4 only
- **D.** storage1, storage2, and storage3 only **← CORRETTA**
- **E.** storage1, storage2, storage3, and storage4

**Risposta corretta:** D
> Esibito: q190_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** Lifecycle management rules in Azure are supported for certain types of storage accounts. These include general-purpose v2 (GPv2) accounts, Blob storage accounts, and premium block blob storage accounts. Therefore, lifecycle management rules can be applied to storage1, storage2, and storage3, as they are of the types StorageV2, BlobStorage, and BlockBlobStorage respectively. However, lifecycle management rules do not support FileStorage account types, so storage4 is not included. Thus, the correct options would be storage1, storage2, and storage3 only.

You create an Azure Storage account named contosostorage. You plan to create a file share named data. Users need to map a drive to the data file share from home computers that run Windows 10. Which outbound port should you open between the home computers and the data file share?

- **A.** 80
- **B.** 443
- **C.** 445 **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** 3389

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To map a drive to an Azure file share from home computers that run Windows 10, the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is required. The SMB protocol uses TCP port 445 for file sharing over the network. Therefore, outbound port 445 should be opened between the home computers and the data file share to ensure the connection can be established.

You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure Storage account named storageaccount1. You export storageaccount1 as an Azure Resource Manager template. The template contains the following sections. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point

**Risposta corretta:** A server that has a public IP address of 131.107.103.10 can access storageaccount1 -> Yes | Individual blobs in storageaccount1 can be set to use the archive tier -> Yes | Global administrations in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) can access a file share hosted in storageaccount1 by using their Azure AD credentials -> No
> Immagini: q193_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** networkAcls has defaultAction set to Allow with no IP or virtual network rules, so the account accepts connections from any network, including the server at 131.107.103.10. The account is StorageV2 (general-purpose v2), which supports per-blob tiering: individual blobs can be set to Archive even though the account default tier is Hot. Identity-based authentication for Azure Files is not configured in the template (no azureFilesIdentityBasedAuthentication), so Azure AD credentials cannot be used to access its file shares, whatever the user's role.

- **A.** the access tier
- **B.** an access policy **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** the Access control (IAM) settings
- **D.** the access level

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To prevent new content added to container1 from being modified for one year, you need to configure a time-based retention policy. This can be achieved by setting up an access policy that specifies the retention interval. Once configured, the data will be in an immutable state, meaning it cannot be modified or deleted during the specified retention period.

You have an Azure Storage account named storage1 that contains a blob container. The blob container has a default access tier of Hot. Storage1 contains a container named conainer1. You create lifecycle management rules in storage1 as shown in the following table. You perform the actions shown in the following table. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** On October 10, you can read Dep1File1.docx. -> No | On October 10, you can read File2.docx. -> Yes | On October 10, you can read File3.docx. -> Yes
> Immagini: q196_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Dep1File1.docx matches Rule1 (prefix container1/Dep1): last modified on October 2, it moves to the archive tier two days later, so on October 10 it is archived and cannot be read until it is rehydrated. File2.docx, edited on October 5, follows Rule2 and is moved to cool on October 8 - still readable. File3.docx, edited on October 2, moves to cool on October 5 and would go to archive only after nine days, on October 11, so on October 10 it can still be read.

You are configuring Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication for an Azure Storage account named storage1. You need to ensure that the members of a group named Group1 can upload files by using the Azure portal. The solution must use the principle of least privilege. Which two roles should you configure for storage1? Each correct answer presents part of the solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- **A.** Storage Account Contributor
- **B.** Storage Blob Data Contributor **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Reader **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Contributor
- **E.** Storage Blob Data Reader

**Risposta corretta:** B, C

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that the members of Group1 can upload files to a storage account using the Azure portal, while adhering to the principle of least privilege, two roles should be configured. First, the 'Storage Blob Data Contributor' role allows for essential operations on blob data such as read, write, and delete, which are necessary for uploading files. Second, the 'Reader' role gives the user read access to see the storage account and its properties but does not allow any modifications. This role is needed to navigate the portal and access the storage resources. Additionally, since the task requires uploading files and managing data actions, these roles together provide the required permissions without granting unnecessary access.

You have an Azure Storage account named storage1 that stores images. You need to create a new storage account and replicate the images in storage1 to the new account by using object replication. How should you configure the new account? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Account type -> StorageV2 only | Object type to create in the new account -> Container
> Esibito: q198_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** Object replication copies block blobs asynchronously between containers, and both the source and the destination account must be general-purpose v2 (StorageV2) or premium block blob accounts: legacy BlobStorage and FileStorage accounts are not supported. In the new account you create a container, which the replication policy uses as the destination for the source container's blobs.

- **D.** az storage blob copy start-batch D:\Folder1 https://contosodata.blob.core.windows.net/public

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To copy the contents of a local folder to an Azure Storage container, you should use the 'azcopy copy' command. This command is designed to copy data from a source to a destination, and the '-- recursive' flag is necessary to ensure that all contents within the directory, including subdirectories, are copied. The correct format for the command includes specifying the source path and the destination URL. In this case, the appropriate command is 'azcopy copy D:\folder1 https://contosodata.blob.core.windows.net/public --recursive'.

In the Azure portal, you plan to create a storage account named storage1 that will have the following settings: Performance: Standard Replication: Zone-redundant storage (ZRS) Access tier (default): Cool Hierarchical namespace: Disabled You need to ensure that you can set Account kind for storage1 to BlockBlobStorage. Which setting should you modify first?

- **A.** Performance **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Replication
- **C.** Access tier (default)
- **D.** Hierarchical namespace

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To set the Account kind for a storage account to BlockBlobStorage, the Performance setting must be changed to Premium. BlockBlobStorage is a specialized account type that is only available in the Premium performance tier, which is optimized for scenarios requiring low latency and high transaction rates. Therefore, modifying the Performance setting to Premium will allow you to select BlockBlobStorage as the account kind.

You create an Azure Storage account. You plan to add 10 blob containers to the storage account. For one of the containers, you need to use a different key to encrypt data at rest. What should you do before you create the container?

- **A.** Generate a shared access signature (SAS).
- **B.** Modify the minimum TLS version.
- **C.** Rotate the access keys.
- **D.** Create an encryption scope. **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** To use a different key to encrypt data at rest for one specific container in an Azure Storage account, you should create an encryption scope before creating the container. An encryption scope is a configuration that establishes the encryption settings for a storage container, allowing you to specify a unique key for encrypting data. By setting up an encryption scope, you can manage encryption keys for individual containers or blobs, ensuring secure and separate encryption within the same storage account.

You have an Azure subscription. The subscription contains a storage account named storage1 that has the lifecycle management rules shown in the following table. On June 1, you store two blobs in storage1 as shown in the following table. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** On June 6, File1 will be stored in the Cool access tier. -> No | On June 1, File2 will be stored in the Cool access tier. -> No | On June 16, File2 will be stored in the Archive access tier. -> No
> Immagini: q203_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** File1 is in container1, so Rule1 moves it to archive after 3 days, on June 4; on June 6 it is in Archive, not Cool (when several rules apply, the cheaper action - archive - wins over cool). File2 is uploaded to the Hot tier and on June 1 it is still Hot. On June 6 Rule2 moves File2 to Cool, and on June 11 Rule3 deletes it (10 days in container2), so by June 16 there is nothing left for Rule4 to archive.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named storage1. The storage1 account contains a container named container1. You need to create a lifecycle management rule for storage1 that will automatically move the blobs in container1 to the lowest-cost tier after 90 days. How should you complete the rule? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** "baseBlob" (box 1) -> "tierToArchive":{ | "filters" (box 2) -> "prefixMatch":[
> Immagini: q206_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** The lowest-cost tier is Archive, so the baseBlob action is tierToArchive (with daysAfterModificationGreaterThan: 90). To restrict the rule to container1, the filters section uses prefixMatch with the container name ("container1/"); blobTypes is also required but only states the blob type (blockBlob), and blobIndexMatch filters on index tags, not on containers.

The solution must ensure that backups are stored across three availability zones in the primary region. Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

**Risposta corretta:** 1. Create a Recovery Services vault. -> 2. Set Replication to Zone-redundant storage (ZRS). -> 3. For VM1, create a backup policy and configure the backup.
> Immagini: q207_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Backups of an Azure VM are stored in a Recovery Services vault, so you create the vault first. Storing them across three availability zones of the primary region requires the vault's storage replication type to be zone-redundant (ZRS), and it must be set before any item is protected, because it cannot be changed afterwards.

- **C.** Task1, Task3, and Task4 only
- **D.** Task2, Task3, and Task4 only **← CORRETTA**
- **E.** Task1, Task2, Task3, and Task4

**Risposta corretta:** D
> Esibito: q209_pre0.png, q209_pre1.png

**Spiegazione:** Azure Storage Explorer is a tool used for managing existing Azure storage accounts and their contents. This tool allows you to upload data to blob containers, create and manage file shares, and add data to storage tables. However, it does not include the capability to create a new storage account. Therefore, tasks that can be successfully performed using Azure Storage Explorer are uploading an append blob to a container, creating a file share in an existing storage account, and adding data to an existing storage table. Creating a new storage account would require using other tools or the Azure Portal. Thus, task 2, task 3, and task 4 can be performed using Azure Storage Explorer.

**Spiegazione:** key1 is a storage account access key: whoever uses it has full access to every service in the account, regardless of RBAC roles, so User1 can write to Table1, folder1 and container1. SAS1 is signed with key1 but allows only the Table service, so with SAS1 User1 can write to Table1 only - the File and Blob services are not included.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the storage account shown in the following exhibit. Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** The maximum number of additional stored access policies that you can create for container1 is [answer choice]. -> 3 | The maximum number of additional immutable blob storage policies that you can create for container1 is [answer choice]. -> 1
> Immagini: q213_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** A container can have at most five stored access policies: Policy1 and Policy2 already exist, so three more can be created. For immutable storage a container can have one time-based retention policy and one legal hold: the time-based retention policy already exists, so the only policy you can still add is a legal hold.

*Tipo: multiple_choice · fonte: text_layer*

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1. You have 5 TB of data that you need to transfer to Subscription1. You plan to use an Azure Import/Export job. What can you use as the destination of the imported data?

- **A.** Azure Blob Storage **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Azure Data Lake Store
- **C.** Azure SQL Database
- **D.** a virtual machine

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** Azure Import/Export service is designed for transferring large amounts of data to and from Azure Blob Storage and Azure Files by shipping disk drives to an Azure datacenter. Therefore, you can use Azure Blob Storage as the destination for the imported data.

## Domanda 215
*Tipo: multiple_choice · fonte: text_layer*

You have an Azure subscription. The subscription contains a storage account named storage1 that has the lifecycle management rules shown in the following table. On June 1, you store a blob named File1 in the Hot access tier of storage1. What is the state of File1 on June 7?

- **A.** stored in the Cool access tier
- **B.** stored in the Archive access tier
- **C.** stored in the Hot access tier
- **D.** deleted **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D
> Esibito: q215_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** Based on the lifecycle management rules provided, all actions are triggered if the base blobs are last modified more than 5 days ago. When multiple rules apply to a blob, Azure lifecycle management applies the least expensive action. In this case, deleting the blob is less expensive than moving it to either cool or archive storage. Therefore, the blob would be deleted on June 7.

## Domanda 216
*Tipo: hotspot · fonte: manual_vision*

You have an Azure subscription that contains the storage accounts shown in the following table. You need to identify which storage accounts support lifecycle management, and which storage accounts support moving data to the Archive access tier. Which storage accounts should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Lifecycle management -> storage1, storage2, and storage3 | The Archive access tier -> storage2 only
> Immagini: q216_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Lifecycle management is available for general-purpose v2, Blob storage and premium block blob (BlockBlobStorage) accounts, so all three accounts support it. The Archive tier is supported only in standard GPv2 and Blob storage accounts that use LRS, GRS or RA-GRS: storage1 uses GZRS and storage3 is a premium account, so only storage2 (Blob storage with RA-GRS) can move data to Archive.

*Tipo: multiple_choice · fonte: text_layer*

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1. You have 5 TB of data that you need to transfer to Subscription1. You plan to use an Azure Import/Export job. What can you use as the destination of the imported data?

- **A.** an Azure Cosmos DB database
- **B.** Azure Data Lake Store
- **C.** Azure Blob storage **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Azure Data Factory

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** The best option for transferring 5 TB of data to an Azure subscription through an Azure Import/Export job is Azure Blob storage. Azure Import/Export service allows you to securely import large amounts of data by shipping disk drives to an Azure datacenter, and data can be imported directly into Azure Blob storage or Azure Files. Therefore, among the given options, Azure Blob storage is the suitable destination for the imported data.

## Domanda 218
*Tipo: hotspot · fonte: manual_vision*

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named storage1. The storage1 account contains a container named container1. You create a blob lifecycle rule named rule1. You need to configure rule1 to automatically move blobs that were NOT updated for 45 days from contained to the Cool access tier. How should you complete the rule? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** "tierToCool" (box 1) -> "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan" | "blobTypes" (box 2) -> "Blockblob"
> Immagini: q218_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Blobs NOT updated for 45 days are selected by daysAfterModificationGreaterThan: 45 inside the tierToCool action (daysAfterCreationGreaterThan counts from creation, daysAfterLastAccessTimeGreaterThan requires access tracking and counts reads too). Lifecycle tiering applies to block blobs, so the blobTypes filter is blockBlob. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/lifecycle-management-overview

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1. You have 5 TB of data that you need to transfer to Subscription1. You plan to use an Azure Import/Export job. What can you use as the destination of the imported data?

- **A.** an Azure Cosmos DB database
- **B.** Azure Blob Storage **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Azure SQL Database
- **D.** the Azure File Sync Storage Sync Service

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Azure Import/Export service is specifically designed to import large amounts of data to Azure Blob Storage. This service facilitates the secure transfer of data by allowing users to ship disk drives directly to an Azure datacenter where data is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage. Therefore, the correct destination of the imported data in this context is Azure Blob Storage.

## Domanda 220
*Tipo: multiple_choice · fonte: text_layer*

You plan to create an Azure Storage account named storage1 that will contain a file share named share1. You need to ensure that share1 can support SMB Multichannel. The solution must minimize costs. How should you configure storage?

- **A.** Premium performance with locally-redundant storage (LRS) **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Standard performance with zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
- **C.** Premium performance with geo-redundant storage (GRS)
- **D.** Standard performance with locally-redundant storage (LRS)

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To support SMB Multichannel in Azure, you need to use premium file shares. Among the redundancy options, locally-redundant storage (LRS) and zone-redundant storage (ZRS) are supported. Since the requirement is to minimize costs, locally-redundant storage (LRS) is the most economical choice while still providing the necessary performance for SMB Multichannel.

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1. You have 5 TB of data that you need to transfer to Subscription1. You plan to use an Azure Import/Export job. What can you use as the destination of the imported data?

- **A.** Azure Data Lake Store
- **B.** Azure File Storage **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Azure SQL Database
- **D.** the Azure File Sync Storage Sync Service

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Azure Import/Export service allows you to transfer large amounts of data to Azure by shipping hard drives to an Azure data center. The supported destinations for the imported data include Azure Blob Storage and Azure File Storage. The other options provided, such as Azure Data Lake Store, Azure SQL Database, and the Azure File Sync Storage Sync Service, are not directly supported as destinations for the Azure Import/Export job. Therefore, Azure File Storage is the correct destination for the imported data.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named storage1. You plan to use conditions when assigning role-based access control (RBAC) roles to storage1. Which storage1 services support conditions when assigning roles?

- **A.** containers only
- **B.** file shares only
- **C.** tables only
- **D.** queues only
- **E.** containers and queues only **← CORRETTA**
- **F.** files shares and tables only

**Risposta corretta:** E

**Spiegazione:** Conditions for role-based access control (RBAC) in Azure can be applied to Blob storage (containers) and Queue storage services. These services support the use of Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication, which is necessary for implementing RBAC with conditions. File shares rely on the SMB protocol and do not use Azure AD for authentication, and tables have their own authentication mechanisms which do not support conditions in the same way.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the resource groups shown in the following table. The subscription contains the virtual networks shown in the following table. You plan to deploy the Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters shown in the following table. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** You can deploy AKS1 to VNet2. -> No | You can deploy AKS2 to VNet1. -> Yes | You can deploy AKS3 to VNet3. -> Yes
> Immagini: q223_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** An AKS cluster must be deployed to a virtual network in the same region. AKS1 is in West US while VNet2 is in Central US, so it cannot use VNet2. AKS2 (West US, Azure CNI, 100 nodes) fits VNet1 in West US: with Azure CNI every node and pod gets a subnet IP - about 100 x 31 addresses with the default 30 pods per node - and the /16 subnet is large enough. AKS3 uses kubenet, where only the nodes take subnet addresses (pods use a separate address space), so 50 nodes fit in the /24 Subnet3 of VNet3, also in East US.

Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution. After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You have an Azure Storage account named storage1.

Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Listing and regenerating access keys requires the Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action and regeneratekey/action permissions. Storage Account Encryption Scope Contributor only lets a user manage encryption scopes (and read the account properties), so it does not meet the goal.

You have an Azure subscription that has offices in the East US and West US Azure regions. You plan to create the storage account shown in the following exhibit. Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** To minimize the network costs of accessing adatum22, modify the [answer choice] setting. -> Default routing tier | After adatum22 is created, you can modify the [answer choice] setting. -> Encryption type
> Immagini: q225_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** adatum22 uses Microsoft network routing, the default routing tier that carries traffic over the Microsoft global network; switching the routing preference to Internet routing sends traffic over the public internet earlier and costs less, so the setting to change is Default routing tier. After creation you can still switch the Encryption type between Microsoft-managed and customer-managed keys, while infrastructure encryption, customer-managed key support for tables and queues, and the premium account type can only be chosen when the account is created.

You have an Azure subscription. You plan to deploy a new storage account. You need to configure encryption for the account. The solution must meet the following requirements: Use a customer-managed key stored in a key vault. Use the maximum supported bit length. Which type of key and which bit length should you use? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Key -> RSA | Bit length -> 4096
> Immagini: q226_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Customer-managed keys for Azure Storage encryption must be RSA or RSA-HSM keys stored in Azure Key Vault or Managed HSM, with a size of 2048, 3072 or 4096 bits; AES and 3DES are not key types you can bring for this purpose. The maximum supported bit length is therefore 4096. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/customer-managed-keys-overview

You have an Azure Storage account that contains 5,000 blobs accessed by multiple users. You need to ensure that the users can view only specific blobs based on blob index tags. What should you include in the solution?

- **A.** a role assignment condition **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** a stored access policy
- **C.** just-in-time (JIT) VM access
- **D.** a shared access signature (SAS)

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that users can view only specific blobs based on blob index tags, you should use a role assignment condition. A role assignment condition provides more fine-grained access control by requiring specific attributes, such as blob index tags, to be met before granting access. This allows you to control access at a very granular level, ensuring users can only view blobs that meet the specified criteria.

## Domanda 228
*Tipo: multiple_choice · fonte: text_layer*

You have an Azure Storage account named storage1. For storage1, you create an encryption scope named Scope1. Which storage types can you encrypt by using Scope?

- **A.** file shares only
- **B.** containers only **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** file shares and containers only
- **D.** containers and tables only
- **E.** file shares, containers, and tables only
- **F.** file shares, containers, tables, and queues

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Encryption scopes are a Blob storage feature: an encryption scope can be set as the default for a container or applied to an individual blob, so the blobs in it are encrypted with that scope's key. File shares, tables and queues cannot use encryption scopes - they are always encrypted with the account-level key (tables and queues can use a customer-managed key only if the account was created with that support).

You have an Azure subscription. You plan to create a role definition to meet the following requirements: Users must be able to view the configuration data of a storage account. Users must be able to perform all actions on a virtual network. The solution must use the principle of least privilege. What should you include in the role definition for each requirement? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Perform all actions on a virtual network -> "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/*" | View the configuration data of a storage account -> "Microsoft.Storage/StorageAccounts/read"
> Immagini: q229_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Performing all actions on a virtual network needs the wildcard Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/*, which covers read, write, delete and every sub-operation; write or delete alone would cover just one action. Viewing the configuration of a storage account is a management-plane read, Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/read: Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/* would also allow changes, and the blob read permission is a data action that reads blob contents, not the configuration.

- **A.** Azure Data Factory
- **B.** the Azure File Sync Storage Sync Service
- **C.** Azure File Storage **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Azure SQL Database

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To transfer data to an Azure subscription using an Azure Import/Export job, the destination can be Azure Blob Storage or Azure File Storage. Azure File Storage, in particular, is designed to store large volumes of unstructured data, making it an appropriate choice for importing 5 TB of data.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual machine named VM1. To VM1, you plan to add a 1-TB data disk that meets the following requirements: Provides data resiliency in the event of a datacenter outage. Provides the lowest latency and the highest performance. Ensures that no data loss occurs if a host fails. You need to recommend which type of storage and host caching to configure for the new data disk.

**Risposta corretta:** Storage type -> Premium SSD that uses zone-redundant storage (ZRS) | Host caching -> Read-only
> Immagini: q231_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Premium SSD gives the lowest latency and the highest performance among the options, and zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replicates the disk synchronously across three availability zones, so the data survives a datacenter outage. Read-only host caching speeds up reads while every write goes straight to the durable disk; Read/Write caching keeps writes in the host cache, where they could be lost if the host fails.

You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 and an Azure key vault named Vault1. On VM1, you plan to configure Azure Disk Encryption to use a key encryption key (KEK). You need to prepare Vault1 for Azure Disk Encryption. Which two actions should you perform on Vault1? Each correct answer presents part of the solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- **A.** Select Azure Virtual machines for deployment.
- **B.** Create a new key. **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Create a new secret.
- **D.** Configure a key rotation policy.
- **E.** Select Azure Disk Encryption for volume encryption. **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B, E

**Spiegazione:** To prepare Vault1 for Azure Disk Encryption, two actions are necessary. First, you need to create a new key in Vault1, as this key will be used as the key encryption key (KEK) for encrypting the virtual machine's disks. Second, you should configure the key vault to enable Azure Disk Encryption for volume encryption. This ensures that the key vault is set up to work with Azure VMs and their disks, allowing the encryption process to utilize the KEK stored in the key vault.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual machine named VM1 and an Azure key vault named KV1. You need to configure encryption for VM1. The solution must meet the following requirements: Store and use the encryption key in KV1. Maintain encryption if VM1 is downloaded from Azure. Encrypt both the operating system disk and the data disks. Which encryption method should you use?

- **A.** customer-managed keys
- **B.** Confidential disk encryption
- **C.** Azure Disk Encryption **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** encryption at host

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) is the most suitable method for configuring encryption for an Azure virtual machine (VM) while meeting the requirements. ADE encrypts both the operating system disk and data disks using BitLocker for Windows VMs and DM-Crypt for Linux VMs. Encryption keys used by ADE can be stored in Azure Key Vault, such as KV1, which ensures that encryption is maintained even if the VM is downloaded from Azure. This solution fully aligns with the specified needs of encrypting both the OS and data disks and storing the encryption key in KV1.

**Risposta corretta:** Allowed resource types -> Object | Allowed permissions -> Read
> Nota: Allowed services: Blob risulta gia' selezionato nell'esibito
> Immagini: q234_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** To download blobs by name, the SAS has to reach individual blobs - the Object resource type - and grant only the Read permission. Service and Container resource types would allow service- or container-level operations, and List would let users enumerate blob names instead of using names they already know.

The solution must meet the following requirements: ONLY allow read access. Allow both HTTP and HTTPS protocols. Apply access permissions to all the content in the container. What should you use?

- **A.** an access policy
- **B.** a shared access signature (SAS) **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)
- **D.** access keys

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To configure access to container1 in an Azure storage account and meet the stated requirements, you should use a shared access signature (SAS). A shared access signature allows you to provide delegated access to resources in your storage account with specified permissions, such as read-only access. Additionally, it enables control over the allowed protocols (both HTTP and HTTPS) and the application of these permissions to all content within the container.

You need to create an Azure Storage account named storage1. The solution must meet the following requirements: Support Azure Data Lake Storage. Minimize costs for infrequently accessed data. Automatically replicate data to a secondary Azure region. Which three options should you configure for storage1? Each correct answer presents part of the solution. NOTE: Each correct answer is worth one point.

- **A.** zone-redundant storage (ZRS)
- **B.** the Cool access tire **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** geo-redundant storage (GRS) **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** the Hot access tier
- **E.** hierarchical namespace **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B, C, E

**Spiegazione:** To create an Azure Storage account that supports Azure Data Lake Storage, minimizes costs for infrequently accessed data, and automatically replicates data to a secondary Azure region, you need to configure it with the Cool access tier, geo-redundant storage, and hierarchical namespace. The Cool access tier is optimized for lower storage costs for infrequently accessed data. Geo-redundant storage ensures data is replicated to a secondary Azure region, meeting the requirement for automatic replication. The hierarchical namespace is necessary for supporting Azure Data Lake Storage, which allows for a file system interface.

You have an Azure Storage account named storage1 that contains two containers named container1 and container2. Blob versioning is enabled for both containers. You periodically take blob snapshots of critical blobs. You create the following lifecycle management policy. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** A blob snapshot automatically moves to the Cool access tier after 15 days. -> No | A blob version in container2 automatically moves to the Archive access tier after 30 days. -> No | A rehydrated version automatically moves to the Archive access tier after 30 days. -> No
> Esibito: q237_pre0.png, q237_pre1.png

**Spiegazione:** The rule defines actions only in the version block and filters on container1/ for block blobs. Snapshots are managed by a separate snapshot block, which this policy does not contain, so a blob snapshot never moves to Cool by itself. Blob versions in container2 do not match the prefix container1/, so nothing happens to them. A rehydrated version is moved back to Archive only once daysAfterLastTierChangeGreaterThan (7 days) is also satisfied, so it does not simply go back to Archive after 30 days.

- **A.** storage1
- **B.** storage2 **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** storage3
- **D.** storage4

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q238_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To convert to zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replication, the storage account must be of the types: Standard general-purpose v2 (StorageV2), Premium block blobs (BlockBlobStorage), or Premium file shares (FileStorage). Additionally, the replication should initially be locally-redundant storage (LRS) or geographically-redundant storage (GRS). In this case, storage2 fits the requirements as it is a Standard general-purpose v2 (StorageV2) account with LRS replication.

You plan to use an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to create a blob inventory rule named rule1. You need to ensure that only blobs whose names start with the word finance are stored daily as a CSV file in container1. How should you complete rule1? To answer, select the options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct answer is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** "blobTypes" -> blockBlob | "prefixMatch" -> container1/finance
> Immagini: q241_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** A blob inventory rule filters with blobTypes and prefixMatch. The image files are block blobs, so blobTypes is blockBlob. prefixMatch values start with the container name, so container1/finance selects only the blobs in container1 whose names begin with finance; finance alone would look for a container called finance, and container1/* would include every blob. The daily schedule and the CSV format are set in the rule's schedule and format properties. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/blob-inventory

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named storage1. The storage1 account contains blobs in a container named container1. You plan to share access to storage1. You need to generate a shared access signature (SAS). The solution must meet the following requirements: Ensure that the SAS can only be used to enumerate and download blobs stored in container1. Use the principle of least privilege. Which three settings should you enable? To answer, select the appropriate settings in the answer area.

**Risposta corretta:** Allowed services -> Blob | Allowed resource types -> Container | Allowed permissions -> Read, List
> Immagini: q242_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** The SAS must work only on blobs, so the allowed service is Blob. Enumerating the blobs of a container is a container-level operation, which needs the Container resource type, and the two permissions needed are List (enumerate) and Read (download) - nothing else, for least privilege. Note that the third setting requires both Read and List, and that, strictly, downloading a blob with an account SAS also involves the Object resource type; the official answer highlights Container.

You have an Azure subscription. The subscription contains a storage account named storage1 that has the lifecycle management rules shown in the following table. On June 1, you store two blobs in storage1 as shown in the following table. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** On June 6, File1 will be stored in the Cool access tier. -> No | On June 7, File2 will be stored in the Cool access tier. -> Yes | On June 16, File2 will be stored in the Archive access tier. -> No
> Immagini: q243_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** File1 is in container1: Rule1 moves it to archive after 3 days (June 4), so on June 6 it is in Archive - when rules overlap, the cheaper archive action wins over Rule2's cool. File2 is in container2: Rule2 moves it to Cool after 5 days, so on June 7 it is in Cool. On June 11, 10 days after the upload, Rule3 deletes File2, so on June 16 it cannot be in Archive.

You have an Azure Storage account named contoso2024 that contains the resources shown in the following table. You have users that have permissions for contoso2024 as shown in the following table. The contoso2024 account is configured as shown in the following exhibit. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** User1 can read File1. -> No | User2 can read File2. -> No | User3 can read File1 and File2. -> No
> Immagini: q244_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** contoso2024 has Allow storage account key access disabled, so neither access keys nor SAS tokens signed with them work: only Microsoft Entra authorization with data roles is accepted. User1's Reader role covers the management plane only, not blob data. User2's Storage Account Contributor role manages the account (and could list keys, which are now useless) but grants no data access to the file share. User3 has only an access key, which the account rejects. Nobody can read File1 or File2. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/shared-key-authorization-prevent

*Tipo: hotspot_yes_no · fonte: manual_vision*

You have an Azure subscription linked to a hybrid Microsoft Entra tenant. The tenant contains the users shown in the following table. You create the Azure Files shares shown in the following table. You configure identity-based access for contoso2024 as shown in the following exhibit. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** User1 can access the content in share1. -> No | User2 can access the content in share2. -> Yes | User2 can access the content in share3. -> No
> Immagini: q245_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** contoso2024 uses on-premises AD DS as its identity source, with a default share-level permission (Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor) for all authenticated identities. User1 is cloud-only, not synced from AD DS, so it cannot obtain a Kerberos ticket for the share: no access. User2 is a hybrid identity and share2 is in contoso2024, so it can access share2. share3 is in contoso2025, which has no identity-based access configured here, so User2 cannot access it with its identity.

## Domanda 246
*Tipo: hotspot_yes_no · fonte: manual_vision*

Your network contains an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain. The domain contains the identities shown in the following table. You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account named storage1. The file shares in storage1 have an identity source of AD DS and Default share-level permissions set to Enable permissions for all authenticated users and groups. You create an Azure Files share named share1 that has the roles shown in the following table. You have a Microsoft Entra tenant that contains a cloud-only user named User3. You use Microsoft Entra Connect to sync OU1 from the AD DS domain to the Microsoft Entra tenant. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** User1 can access content in share1. -> Yes | User2 can access content in share1. -> Yes | User3 can access content in share1. -> No
> Immagini: q246_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** The default share-level permission applies to every identity that authenticates against AD DS, synced or not, and User1 is also a member of Group1, which holds Storage File Data SMB Share Contributor: User1 can access share1. User2 is in OU1, synced, and has Storage File Data SMB Share Reader: it can access share1. User3 is a cloud-only Microsoft Entra user with no AD DS account, so it cannot authenticate with the AD DS identity source of storage1.

## Domanda 247
*Tipo: multiple_choice · fonte: text_layer*

You have an Azure subscription that contains the storage accounts shown in the following table. Which storage account can be converted to zone-redundant storage (ZRS) replication?

- **A.** storage1 only **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** storage2 only
- **C.** storage3 only
- **D.** storage2 and storage3
- **E.** storage1, storage2, and storage3

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q247_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** Conversion to zone-redundant storage is supported for standard general-purpose v2 accounts that use LRS: storage1 qualifies. storage2 uses RA-GRS, a geo-redundant option, which cannot be converted straight to ZRS (it would have to become LRS first, or move to GZRS/RA-GZRS instead). storage3 is a legacy BlobStorage account, which does not support ZRS at all.

Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution. After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You have an Azure Storage account named storage1. You need to enable a user named User1 to list and regenerate storage account keys for storage1. Solution: You assign the Reader and Data Access role to User1. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Reader and Data Access lets a user view the storage account and list its access keys (Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/listkeys/action), but it does not include regeneratekey/action, so User1 could not regenerate the keys. The role meant for this task is Storage Account Key Operator Service Role. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/storage

## Domanda 249
*Tipo: multiple_choice · fonte: text_layer*

You have an Azure subscription that contains a Standard SKU Azure container registry named ContReg1. You need to ensure that ContReg1 supports geo-replication. What should you do first for ContReg1?

- **A.** Enable Admin user.
- **B.** Add a scope map.
- **C.** Add an automation task.
- **D.** Create a cache rule.
- **E.** Upgrade the SKU. **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** E

**Spiegazione:** Geo-replication of an Azure container registry is available only in the Premium service tier. ContReg1 is Standard, so the first step is to upgrade its SKU to Premium; after that you can add replicas in other regions. The admin user, scope maps, automation tasks and cache rules are unrelated to geo-replication.

Overview

ADatum Corporation is consulting firm that has a main office in Montreal and branch offices in Seattle and New York.

Existing Environment

Azure Environment

ADatum has an Azure subscription that contains three resource groups named RG1, RG2, and RG3. The subscription contains the storage accounts shown in the following table. The subscription contains the virtual machines shown in the following table. The subscription has an Azure container registry that contains the images shown in the following table. The subscription contains the resources shown in the following table.

Azure Key Vault

The subscription contains an Azure key vault named Vault1. Vault1 contains the certificates shown in the following table. Vault1 contains the keys shown in the following table.

Microsoft Entra Environment

ADatum has a Microsoft Entra tenant named adatum.com that is linked to the Azure subscription and contains the users shown in the following table. The tenant contains the groups shown in the following table. The adatum.com tenant has a custom security attribute named Attribute1.

Planned Changes

ADatum plans to implement the following changes:

Configure a data collection rule (DCR) named DCR1 to collect only system events that have an event ID of 4648 from VM2 and VM4.
In storage1, create a new container named cont2 that has the following access policies:
  Three stored access policies named Stored1, Stored2, and Stored3
  A legal hold for immutable blob storage
Whenever possible, use directories to organize storage account content.
Grant User1 the permissions required to link Zone1 to VNet1.
Assign Attribute1 to supported adatum.com resources.
In storage2, create an encryption scope named Scope1.
Deploy new containers by using Image1 or Image2.

Technical Requirements

ADatum must meet the following technical requirements:

Use TLS for WebApp1.
Follow the principle of least privilege.
Grant permissions at the required scope only.
Ensure that Scope1 is used to encrypt storage services.
Use Azure Backup to back up cont1 and share1 as frequently as possible.
Whenever possible, use Azure Disk Encryption and a key encryption key (KEK) to encrypt the virtual machines.

You implement the planned changes for cont2. What is the maximum number of additional access policies you can create for cont2? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Stored access policies -> 2 | Immutable blob storage policies -> 1
> Immagini: q250_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** A container supports at most five stored access policies: cont2 will have Stored1, Stored2 and Stored3, so two more can be added. For immutable blob storage a container can have one legal hold and one time-based retention policy: the legal hold is already planned, so the only additional immutability policy is a single time-based retention policy.

Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution. After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster named AKS1. You need to deploy a YAML file to AKS1. Solution: From Azure CLI, you run az aks. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To deploy a YAML file to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, you need to use the kubectl command. The az aks command in Azure CLI is used to manage AKS clusters, such as creating, updating, or deleting the clusters, but not for deploying resources into the clusters. The correct command to deploy a YAML file is kubectl apply -f.yaml.

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To deploy a YAML file to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, you would use the Kubernetes command-line client, kubectl. The command kubectl apply -f is specifically designed for this purpose, allowing you to apply configuration defined in a YAML file to your AKS cluster. Thus, using kubectl from the Azure CLI meets the goal of deploying a YAML file to AKS1.

- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To deploy a YAML file to an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, you use the 'kubectl' command line tool, not 'azcopy'. The correct command is 'kubectl apply -f.yaml'. This command applies the configuration specified in the YAML file to the AKS cluster. 'azcopy' is used for transferring data to and from Azure Storage, not for deploying resources to Kubernetes clusters.

As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 that runs Windows Server 2016. You need to create an alert in Azure when more than two error events are logged to the System event log on VM1 within an hour. Solution: You create an Azure storage account and configure shared access signatures (SASs). You install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent on VM1. You create an alert in Azure Monitor and specify the storage account as the source. Does that meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** The proposed solution involves creating an Azure storage account and configuring shared access signatures (SASs), which is unnecessary for the goal of monitoring error events in a VM's System event log. The correct method involves creating an Azure Log Analytics workspace and configuring the data settings, then installing the Microsoft Monitoring Agent on VM1. Azure Monitor can then be used to create an alert, specifying the Log Analytics workspace as the source, not a storage account. This approach leverages the appropriate tools for log collection and monitoring within the Azure ecosystem.

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1. Subscription1 contains the resources in the following table. VNet1 is in RG1. VNet2 is in RG2. There is no connectivity between VNet1 and VNet2. An administrator named Admin1 creates an Azure virtual machine named VM1 in RG1. VM1 uses a disk named Disk1 and connects to VNet1. Admin1 then installs a custom application in VM1. You need to move the custom application to VNet2. The solution must minimize administrative effort. Which two actions should you perform? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** First action -> Delete VM1. | Second action -> Create a new virtual machine.
> Immagini: q257_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** We cannot just move a virtual machine between networks. What we need to do is identify the disk used by the VM, delete the VM itself while retaining the disk, and recreate the VM in the target virtual network and then attach the original disk to it.

You download an Azure Resource Manager template based on an existing virtual machine. The template will be used to deploy 100 virtual machines. You need to modify the template to reference an administrative password. You MUST prevent the password from being stored in plain text. What should you create to store the password?

- **A.** an Azure Key Vault and an access policy **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** an Azure Storage account and an access policy
- **C.** a Recovery Services vault and a backup policy
- **D.** Azure Active Directory (AD) Identity Protection and an Azure policy

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To securely store an administrative password and prevent it from being stored in plain text in an Azure Resource Manager template, you should use an Azure Key Vault. Azure Key Vault allows you to store sensitive information such as passwords, secrets, and encryption keys. By referencing the Key Vault in the ARM template, the password can be securely retrieved during deployment, ensuring it is not exposed in plain text. An access policy in the Key Vault will control who and what can access the stored secrets, providing an additional layer of security.

You create a virtual machine scale set named Scale1. Scale1 is configured as shown in the following exhibit. Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** If Scale1 is utilized at 85 percent for six minutes after it is deployed, Scale1 will be running [answer choice]. -> 6 virtual machines | If Scale1 is first utilized at 25 percent for six minutes after it is deployed, and then utilized at 50 percent for six minutes, Scale1 will be running [answer choice]. -> 2 virtual machines
> Immagini: q260_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Box 1: 6 virtual machines - The Autoscale scale out rule increases the number of VMs by 2 if the CPU threshold is 80% or higher. The initial instance count is 4 and rises to 6 when the 2 extra instances of VMs are added. Box 2: 2 virtual machnes - The Autoscale scale in rule decreases the number of VMs by 4 if the CPU threshold is 30% or lower. The initial instance count is 4 and thus cannot be reduced to 0 as the minimum instances is set to 2. Instances are only added when the CPU threshold reaches 80%.

- **B.** From webapp1, modify the Application settings
- **C.** From webapp1, add a custom domain
- **D.** From Plan1, scale out the App Service plan

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To create a staging slot, the Azure App Service plan must support this feature, which is available only in the Standard, Premium, or Isolated tiers. If the option to create a staging slot is unavailable, it likely means that the current App Service plan is in a lower tier, such as Free or Basic. Scaling up the App Service plan will upgrade it to a higher tier that includes the staging slot feature, along with increased CPU, memory, and other resources.

You plan to move a distributed on-premises app named App1 to an Azure subscription. After the planned move, App1 will be hosted on several Azure virtual machines. You need to ensure that App1 always runs on at least eight virtual machines during planned Azure maintenance. What should you create?

- **A.** one virtual machine scale set that has 10 virtual machines instances **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** one Availability Set that has three fault domains and one update domain
- **C.** one Availability Set that has 10 update domains and one fault domain
- **D.** one virtual machine scale set that has 12 virtual machines instances

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that App1 always runs on at least eight virtual machines during planned Azure maintenance, you should create a virtual machine scale set with 10 virtual machine instances. In a virtual machine scale set, the instances are identically configured, and Azure can distribute the load across multiple instances, with a maximum of 20% of the instances being updated at a time during maintenance. This means that at most 2 out of 10 machines will be updated simultaneously, leaving at least 8 machines running, which meets the requirement.

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To move an Azure virtual machine to a different host immediately due to maintenance, you need to redeploy the VM to a new node. Moving a virtual machine to a different subscription does not accomplish this, as it only changes the billing and corporate structure without affecting the underlying physical host. Redeploying a VM involves re-provisioning it on a different node, ensuring that it runs on different hardware, thus mitigating the impact of maintenance on the original host.

Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q273_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** The proposed solution suggests deleting VM1 and recreating it in VNET2. However, it is important to note that VM1 and VNET2 are located in different regions. Azure does not support placing a VM in a virtual network that is in a different region. Therefore, simply recreating VM1 in the same resource group while attempting to connect it to VNET2 will not work. As VM1 and VNET2 are in different regions, additional steps such as migration of the VM to the different region are required. Consequently, the solution does not meet the goal of connecting VM1 from VNET1 to VNET2. Thus, the correct answer is no.

**Spiegazione:** When connecting an existing Azure VM to a different virtual network (VNet), it's essential to understand that a VM's network interface can only be connected to VNets within the same region. Since VM1 is located in West US and VNET2 is in East Asia, simply adding a new network interface is insufficient. To connect VM1 to VNET2, the VM must be recreated in the region where VNET2 exists. This involves deleting VM1, copying its disk to East Asia, and then creating a new VM in East Asia that connects to VNET2. Thus, the given solution does not meet the goal, confirming that the correct answer is 'No'.

- **B.** Add a 500-GB managed disk
- **C.** Change the size to D8s v3 **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Add the Puppet Agent extension

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** Changing the size of an Azure virtual machine causes it to be restarted, which will result in downtime for the VM. This is because the virtual machine needs to be stopped and deallocated to change its size, and the process of resizing may require moving to a different hardware cluster. Other changes like adding a managed disk, installing extensions, or enabling Desired State Configuration Management do not inherently require downtime and can be performed while the VM is running.

**Spiegazione:** When an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) is created, it must be associated with a specific Virtual Network (VNet). Although you can modify the subnet a VM is connected to after creation, it is not possible to change the VNet directly. Therefore, to connect VM1 to VNET2, the correct approach is to delete VM1, recreate it, and then ensure that the new VM is associated with VNET2 by adding the appropriate network interface during the deployment process. Simply creating a new network interface and adding it to VM1 will not achieve the goal.

You have an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant named adatum.com that contains the users shown in the following table. Adatum.com has the following configurations:

Users may join devices to Azure AD is set to User1.
Additional local administrators on Azure AD joined devices is set to None.

You deploy Windows 10 to a computer named Computer1. User1 joins Computer1 to adatum.com. You need to identify the local Administrator group membership on Computer1. Which users are members of the local Administrators group?

- **A.** User1 only
- **B.** User2 only
- **C.** User1 and User2 only **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** User1, User2, and User3 only
- **E.** User1, User2, User3, and User4

**Risposta corretta:** C
> Esibito: q288_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** In an Azure Active Directory environment, users who join devices to Azure AD are automatically made local administrators of those devices. Additionally, Global Administrators in Azure AD also have local administrator rights by default. Therefore, on Computer1, User1, who performed the Azure AD join, and User2, who is a Global Administrator, will be members of the local Administrators group. User3 and User4, holding the roles of Cloud Device Administrator and Intune Administrator respectively, do not grant the local administrator rights by default. As such, the correct answer is that User1 and User2 will be the members of the local Administrators group.

You have Azure subscriptions named Subscription1 and Subscription2. Subscription1 has following resource groups: RG1 includes a web app named App1 in the West Europe location. Subscription2 contains the following resource groups: For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** App1 can be moved to RG2 -> No | App1 can be moved to RG3 -> Yes | App1 can be moved to RG4 -> Yes
> Esibito: q289_pre0.png, q289_pre1.png, q289_pre2.png

**Spiegazione:** Moving a resource changes only its resource group (and possibly subscription), never its region, so the region of the target resource group does not matter. Locks do: Azure resources cannot be moved if a read-only lock exists on the source or destination resource group or subscription, so App1 cannot be moved to RG2. RG3 has only a Delete lock, which does not prevent adding resources, and RG4 has no lock, so App1 can be moved to either of them (to another subscription in the same tenant, together with its App Service plan).

> Immagini: q306_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Box 1: 2 - CPU at 70% for one hour triggers neither rule (scale out needs a maximum CPU above 85%, scale in an average CPU below 30%), so the plan stays at the default of 1 instance. Once the CPU reaches 90% for five minutes, the scale out condition holds for the whole 5-minute duration and the count increases by 1, to 2. Box 2: 4 - One hour at 90% triggers the scale out rule repeatedly until the maximum of 5 instances is reached. When the average CPU drops below 25%, the scale in rule fires after 5 minutes and the count decreases by 1, to 4. The 5-minute cool down that follows only ends at minute 10, so at minute 9 no second scale in has happened yet.

**Spiegazione:** When you redeploy an Azure virtual machine, the data on the temporary drive, often designated as drive D, will be lost. This temporary storage is used primarily for storing page files and other transient data. In contrast, the changes made on the C drive, such as modifying the screen saver timeout, changing the desktop background, and creating files, will be retained because the C drive is persistent storage. Therefore, the new files on drive D will be lost after redeploying VM1.

You plan to back up an Azure virtual machine named VM1. You discover that the Backup Pre-Check status displays a status of Warning. What is a possible cause of the Warning status?

- **A.** VM1 is stopped.
- **B.** VM1 does not have the latest version of the Azure VM Agent (WaAppAgent.exe) installed. **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** VM1 has an unmanaged disk.
- **D.** A Recovery Services vault is unavailable.

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** The Warning status in the Backup Pre-Check typically indicates an issue with the Azure virtual machine's configuration that could potentially lead to backup failures. One common cause for this warning is that the virtual machine does not have the latest version of the Azure VM Agent (WaAppAgent.exe) installed. The Azure VM Agent is crucial as it facilitates the communication between the virtual machine and Azure to perform various operations, including backups. An outdated or missing VM Agent can result in intermittent backup failures, thereby triggering a warning in the Backup Pre-Check status.

Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution. After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1. VM1 was deployed by using a custom Azure Resource Manager template named ARM1.json. You receive a notification that VM1 will be affected by maintenance. You need to move VM1 to a different host immediately. Solution: From the Overview blade, you move the virtual machine to a different resource group. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Moving a virtual machine to a different resource group does not change its physical host. Resource groups are logical containers for managing resources, but they do not affect where the virtual machine is physically hosted. To move VM1 to a different host immediately, you would need to redeploy it, which places the VM on a new host server within Azure.

You have an Azure subscription. You plan to use Azure Resource Manager templates to deploy 50 Azure virtual machines that will be part of the same availability set. You need to ensure that as many virtual machines as possible are available if the fabric fails or during servicing. How should you configure the template? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** "platformFaultDomainCount" -> 3 | "platformUpdateDomainCount" -> 20
> Immagini: q315_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** In an availability set, VMs are spread across fault domains (shared power and network) and update domains (rebooted together during servicing). Most regions support up to 3 fault domains and an availability set supports up to 20 update domains, so platformFaultDomainCount 3 and platformUpdateDomainCount 20 keep as many of the 50 VMs as possible running during a fabric failure or planned maintenance.

As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1 that runs Windows Server 2016. You need to create an alert in Azure when more than two error events are logged to the System event log on VM1 within an hour. Solution: You create an Azure Log Analytics workspace and configure the Agent configuration settings. You install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent on VM1. You create an alert in Azure Monitor and specify the Log Analytics workspace as the source. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To create an alert in Azure when more than two error events are logged to the System event log on a virtual machine within an hour, follow these steps: First, configure an Azure Log Analytics workspace which collects log data. Next, install the Microsoft Monitoring Agent (MMA) on the virtual machine to send event log data to the Log Analytics workspace. Finally, create an alert rule in Azure Monitor using the Log Analytics workspace as the data source. This setup ensures that the specified log events trigger the desired alert in Azure Monitor.

You have an Azure subscription. You deploy a virtual machine scale set that is configured as shown in the following exhibit. Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that answers each question based on the information presented in the graphic NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** At 9:00 AM, the scale set starts and CPU utilization is 90 percent for 15 minutes. How many virtual machine instances will be running at 9:15 AM? -> 3 | At 10:00 AM, the scale set has five virtual machine instances running and CPU utilization falls to less than 15 percent for 60 minutes. How many virtual machine instances will be running at 11:00 AM? -> 1
> Immagini: q317_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** The scale set starts with 2 instances and scales out by 1 when CPU stays above 75% for 10 minutes: at 9:10 one instance is added, and the cooldown that follows prevents another action before 9:15, so 3 instances are running. From 10:00 CPU is below the 25% scale-in threshold for an hour: the scale set removes one instance at a time, after each evaluation window and cooldown, until it reaches the minimum of 1 VM, so 1 instance is running at 11:00.

You have web apps in the West US, Central US and East US Azure regions. You have the App Service plans shown in the following table. You plan to create an additional App Service plan named ASP5 that will use the Linux operating system. You need to identify in which of the currently used locations you can deploy ASP5. What should you recommend?

- **A.** West US, Central US, or East US **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Central US only
- **C.** East US only
- **D.** West US only

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q318_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** App Service Plans can be deployed in any region where Azure is available, and you already have web apps deployed in West US, Central US, and East US Azure regions. Additionally, since you can have multiple app service plans in the same region and the operating system does not restrict deployment to any specific regions, you can deploy ASP5 in any of the currently used regions (West US, Central US, or East US). Therefore, the correct recommendation is to deploy ASP5 in West US, Central US, or East US.

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To deploy a YAML file in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, you need to use the 'kubectl' command-line tool, which is designed for interacting with and managing Kubernetes clusters. The appropriate command to deploy a YAML file is 'kubectl apply -f.yaml'. The 'az aks' command is used for managing AKS clusters at a higher level, such as creating, scaling, and updating clusters, but it is not used for deploying YAML files directly to the cluster. Therefore, using 'az aks' to deploy a YAML file does not meet the goal.

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q326_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** A network interface attached to a virtual machine must exist in the same location and subscription as the virtual machine, but it can belong to a different resource group. VM1 is located in West US and the solution creates NIC2 in West US, so the location requirement is met. RG1 being located in East US is irrelevant: the location of a resource group only determines where its metadata is stored and does not constrain the location of the resources it contains. Therefore, the solution meets the goal.

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q328_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To create a new network interface named NIC2 for VM1, both the network interface (NIC2) and the virtual machine (VM1) must exist in the same location. VM1 is located in the West US region, so NIC2 must also be created in the West US region. While resource groups can be in different regions and still contain resources in other locations, the critical requirement here is that the NIC and VM must be in the same Azure region. However, the solution proposes creating NIC2 in RG2 and West US, which fulfills both conditions. Thus, the appropriate answer would be that this solution meets the goal.

- **A.** Create a proximity placement group.
- **B.** Deallocate VM1. **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Convert AvSet1 into a managed availability set.
- **D.** Shut down VM2 and VM3.

**Risposta corretta:** After CPU usage has reached 80 percent for 15 minutes, [answer choice] will be running. -> 2 instances | Once the first scale-out instance is created, the minimum time before an additional instance is created will be [answer choice]. -> 15 minutes
> Immagini: q339_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** The scale-out rule adds one instance when average CPU stays above 70% over a 10-minute window, and is followed by a 5-minute cooldown. With CPU at 80%, the first scale action happens after 10 minutes, so after 15 minutes 2 instances are running. After that action autoscale waits out the 5-minute cooldown and then needs another full 10-minute window over the threshold, so the earliest the next instance can be added is 15 minutes after the first.

You have an Azure subscription. You plan to deploy the Azure container instances shown in the following table. Which instances can you deploy to a container group?

- **A.** Instance1 only
- **B.** Instance2 only
- **C.** Instance1 and Instance2 only
- **D.** Instance3 and Instance4 only **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D
> Esibito: q340_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** Azure Container Instances supports multi-container groups only for Linux containers. Windows containers can be deployed only as single container instances, not in multi-container groups. Therefore, only Instance3 and Instance4, which use Linux, can be deployed to a container group.

You have an Azure container registry named contoso2023 as shown in the following exhibit. You need to enable contoso2023 to use a dedicated data endpoint. Which two settings should you configure for contoso2023? To answer, select the appropriate settings in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct answer is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Setting 1 -> Networking | Setting 2 -> Connected registries (Preview)
> Immagini: q341_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Dedicated data endpoints are a Premium feature, and contoso2023 uses the Standard plan, so the registry has to be upgraded to Premium first. The data endpoints are then enabled from the Networking blade (Public access, Dedicated data endpoint). The official answer also highlights Connected registries: a connected registry requires the parent registry to have dedicated data endpoints enabled, but the setting itself lives under Networking.

You have an Azure subscription that has the public IP addresses shown in the following table. You plan to deploy an Instance of Azure Firewall Premium named FW1. Which IP addresses can you use?

- **A.** IP2 only
- **B.** IP1 and IP2 only **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** IP1, IP2, and IP5 only
- **D.** IP1, IP2, IP4, and IP5 only

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q342_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To deploy an Azure Firewall Premium instance, the IP addresses must meet specific criteria: they must be Standard SKU, IPv4, and Static. From the table, IP1 and IP2 meet these requirements. IP3 and IP4 are not suitable because they are of the Basic SKU. IP5 is not suitable because it is IPv6 and Azure Firewall currently does not support IPv6. Therefore, the correct IP addresses that can be used are IP1 and IP2.

You have an Azure subscription. You need to deploy a virtual machine by using an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. How should you complete the template? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** "dependsOn" -> resourceId | "storageProfile" -> ImageReference
> Immagini: q343_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** dependsOn lists the resource IDs of the resources that must be deployed first, so it uses the resourceId() function (for example resourceId('Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces', 'nic1')); reference() reads the runtime state of a resource and union() merges objects or arrays. Inside storageProfile, the imageReference object (publisher, offer, sku, version) selects the image the VM is created from.

You need to configure a new Azure App Service app named WebApp1. The solution must meet the following requirements: WebApp1 must be able to verify a custom domain name of app.contoso.com. WebApp1 must be able to automatically scale up to eight instances. Costs and administrative effort must be minimized. Which pricing plan should you choose, and which type of record should you use to verify the domain? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct answer is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Pricing plan -> Standard | Record type -> TXT
> Immagini: q344_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Autoscale in App Service starts with the Standard tier, which scales out to up to 10 instances, while Free, Shared and Basic offer no autoscale (Basic can only be scaled manually to 3 instances): Standard is the cheapest tier that can scale to eight instances automatically. Ownership of a custom domain is verified with a TXT record (asuid.app.contoso.com) containing the app's domain verification ID, alongside the CNAME or A record that maps the name.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the virtual machines shown in the following table. You create an Azure Compute Gallery named ComputeGallery1 as shown in the Azure Compute Gallery exhibit. (Click the Azure Compute Gallery tab.) In ComputeGallery1, you create a virtual machine image definition named Image1 as shown in the image definition exhibit. (Click the Image Definition tab.) For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No, NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** The operating system disk of VM1 can be used as a source for a version of Image1. -> No | The operating system disk of VM2 can be used as a source for a version of Image1. -> Yes | The operating system disk of VM3 can be used as a source for a version of Image1. -> Yes
> Esibito: q345_pre0.png, q345_pre1.png, q345_pre2.png, q345_pre3.png

**Spiegazione:** An image version must match its image definition in OS type, OS state and Hyper-V generation. Image1 is a Windows, specialized, Generation 1 (V1) definition, and VM1 is a Generation 2 VM, so its OS disk cannot be used as a source for a version of Image1. VM2 and VM3 are Generation 1 VMs: the gallery's region, the definition's region and the recommended vCPU range do not prevent using them, since recommendations are not enforced and the version can be created and replicated across regions.

You plan to create the Azure web apps shown in the following table. What is the minimum number of App Service plans you should create for the web apps?

- **A.** 1
- **B.** 2 **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** 3
- **D.** 4

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q346_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To determine the minimum number of App Service plans needed for the web apps, the key factor to consider is whether the runtime stack requires a Windows or Linux environment. Python 3.11 only runs on Linux, while ASP.NET V4.8 requires a Windows environment. The other runtimes,.NET 6 (LTS) and PHP 8.1, can run on either platform but will have to be placed on the appropriate platform to accommodate the needs of Python and ASP.NET. Therefore, at least two App Service plans are needed: one for Linux to support Python 3.11, and one for Windows to support ASP.NET V4.8. The.NET and PHP applications can share these plans. Thus, the correct answer is two App Service plans.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the resource groups shown in the following table. You create the following Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template named deploy.json. You deploy the template by running the following cmdlet. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** The template creates a resource group named RG0 in the East US Azure region. -> Yes | The template creates four new resource groups. -> No | The template creates a resource group named RG3 in the West US Azure region. -> No
> Immagini: q347_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** The subscription-level deployment loops four times (copyIndex 0-3) over resource groups named RG0 to RG3, all with location eastus, so RG0 is created in East US. RG1 already exists in East US, so it is not new, and RG2 already exists in West US, where its location cannot be changed, so the template does not create four new resource groups. RG3, when created, is placed in East US, not West US - the -Location westus parameter only sets where the deployment metadata is stored.

You have an Azure App Service app named App1 that contains two running instances. You have an autoscale rule configured as shown in the following exhibit. For the Instance limits scale condition setting, you set Maximum to 5. During a 30-minute period, App1 uses 80 percent of the available memory. What is the maximum number of instances for App1 during the 30-minute period?

- **A.** 2
- **B.** 3 **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** 4
- **D.** 5

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q348_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** The autoscale rule has a duration of 15 minutes and a 5-minute cooldown period. App1 starts with 2 instances. After 15 minutes, the memory usage is checked, and since it exceeds 70%, the instance count increases by 1, making it 3 instances. The cooldown period is 5 minutes, during which no scaling occurs. After the cooldown, which is at the 20-minute mark, there is not enough time to meet the 15-minute duration again within the remaining 10 minutes of the 30-minute period. Therefore, the maximum number of instances for App1 during the 30-minute period is 3.

You have an Azure AD tenant named contoso.com. You have an Azure subscription that contains an Azure App Service web app named App1 and an Azure key vault named KV1. KV1 contains a wildcard certificate for contoso.com. You have a user named user1@contoso.com that is assigned the Owner role for App1 and KV1. You need to configure App1 to use the wildcard certificate of KV1. What should you do first?

- **A.** Create an access policy for KV1 and assign the Microsoft Azure App Service principal to the policy. **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Assign a managed user identity to App1.
- **C.** Configure KV1 to use the role-based access control (RBAC) authorization system.
- **D.** Create an access policy for KV1 and assign the policy to User1.

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** By default the App Service resource provider has no access to a key vault. To import a Key Vault certificate into an App Service app, you first authorize the Microsoft Azure App Service service principal to read it, through an access policy (Get on secrets and certificates) or the Key Vault Certificate User role. The app's own managed identity is not used for this import, and User1 already has the permissions to perform the operation as Owner.

You have an Azure subscription. You plan to deploy the resources shown in the following table. You need to create a single Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template that will be used to deploy the resources. Which resource should be added to the dependsOn section for VM1?

- **A.** VNET1
- **B.** NIC1 **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** IP1
- **D.** NSG1

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q351_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** When creating an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template for deploying a virtual machine (VM), it is essential to sequence the dependencies correctly. In this scenario, the network interface card (NIC1) must be created and configured before the VM (VM1) because the VM needs a NIC to connect to the virtual network and other related network resources. Without having the NIC set up first, the VM wouldn't have the necessary network interface to function. Therefore, NIC1 should be added to the dependsOn section for VM1 to ensure proper deployment order.

You have an Azure subscription. You create the following Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template named Template.json. You need to deploy Template.json. Which PowerShell cmdlet should you run from Azure Cloud Shell?

- **A.** New-AzSubscriptionDeployment **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** New-AzManagementGroupDeployment
- **C.** New-AzResourceGroupDeployment
- **D.** New-AzTenantDeployment

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q352_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To deploy an Azure Resource Manager template that creates a new resource group, the appropriate cmdlet to use is New-AzSubscriptionDeployment. This cmdlet is suitable because creating a resource group is an operation at the subscription level, not within an existing resource group. Therefore, the command deploys resources and creates new resource groups at the subscription scope.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a resource group named RG1. You plan to create a storage account named storage1. You have a Bicep file named File1. You need to modify File1 so that it can be used to automate the deployment of storage1 to RG1. Which property should you modify?

- **A.** kind
- **B.** scope **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** sku
- **D.** location

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To automate the deployment of the storage account named storage1 to the resource group RG1 using a Bicep file, you need to modify the scope property. The scope property in a Bicep file specifies the resource group where the resource should be deployed. By adjusting the scope to the resource group RG1, you ensure that the storage account will be created in the desired target resource group.

Your company purchases a new Azure subscription. You create a file named Deploy.json as shown in the following exhibit. You connect to the subscription and run the following cmdlet. `New-AzDeployment -Location westus -TemplateFile "deploy.json"` For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** You can deploy a virtual machine to RG1. -> Yes | You can deploy a virtual machine to RG2. -> No | You can manually create a resource group named RG3. -> Yes
> Immagini: q354_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** The deployment creates RG0, RG1 and RG2 in East US and then, through nested deployments, places a CanNotDelete lock on RG1 and a ReadOnly lock on RG2. A CanNotDelete lock still allows creating and modifying resources, so a virtual machine can be deployed to RG1. A ReadOnly lock blocks every write operation, so no virtual machine can be deployed to RG2. The locks apply only to those groups, so RG3 can be created manually.

- **C.** Proximity1 only **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Proximity1 and Proximity3 only

**Risposta corretta:** C
> Esibito: q355_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To configure a proximity placement group for VMSS1, the proximity placement group should be in the same location as VMSS1, which is West US. Out of the provided options, only Proximity1 is in West US. Therefore, Proximity1 is the suitable choice to achieve the lowest latency for VMSS1 as it ensures that the resources are physically close to each other.

The subscription contains the Azure App Service web apps shown in the following table. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** WebApp1 can communicate with VM2. -> Yes | NSG1 controls inbound traffic to WebApp1. -> No | WebApp2 can communicate with VM1. -> Yes
> Esibito: q356_pre0.png, q356_pre1.png, q356_pre2.png, q356_pre3.png

**Spiegazione:** WebApp1 uses virtual network integration with VNet1, which routes its outbound traffic into VNet1 and on through the peering to VNet2, so it can reach VM2. Virtual network integration is outbound only, so NSG1 on Subnet1 does not control inbound traffic to WebApp1. WebApp2 runs in an App Service Environment deployed into Subnet2: apps in an ASE can reach resources in networks connected to the ASE's virtual network, so through the VNet2-VNet1 peering WebApp2 can communicate with VM1.

**Risposta corretta:** D
> Esibito: q357_pre0.png, q357_pre1.png

**Spiegazione:** The suggested answer is D. Vault1 is located in the West Europe region. In Azure, for a virtual machine to be backed up to a Recovery Services vault, both the vault and the virtual machine must be in the same region. Therefore, only the virtual machines located in West Europe can be backed up to Vault1. These virtual machines are VM1, VM3, VMA, and VMC.

- **A.** root
- **B.** admin
- **C.** administrator
- **D.** ContReg1 **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** When the admin user feature is enabled for an Azure container registry, the username used to sign in is the same as the name of the container registry itself.

- **A.** Enable encryption by using a customer-managed key.
- **B.** Create a connected registry.
- **C.** Add a token.
- **D.** Enable content trust. **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** Pushing and pulling signed images relies on content trust (Docker Content Trust / Notary v1), a Premium-tier feature that you enable on the registry, after which publishers sign the images they push and consumers can verify them when pulling. Customer-managed keys encrypt the registry storage, connected registries replicate content to on-premises, and tokens only scope repository permissions.

**Risposta corretta:** ACR Tasks -> ContReg1, ContReg2, and ContReg3 | Private endpoints -> ContReg1 only
> Immagini: q360_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** ACR Tasks is available in every service tier, so ContReg1 (Premium), ContReg2 (Standard) and ContReg3 (Basic) all support it.

- **A.** Azure Custom Script Extension **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Deployment Center in Azure App Service
- **C.** Microsoft Entra Application Proxy
- **D.** the Publish-AzVMDscConfiguration cmdlet

**Risposta corretta:** A

Questa domanda non ha esibiti, come le altre tre varianti della stessa (304, 319, 331).

**Spiegazione:** The Custom Script Extension downloads and runs a script on each VM after it is provisioned; added to the scale set model in the ARM template (extensionProfile), it runs on every instance, including those added later by scaling, so a script that installs NGINX makes it available everywhere. Deployment Center publishes code to App Service apps, Microsoft Entra Application Proxy publishes on-premises web apps, and Publish-AzVMDscConfiguration only uploads a DSC configuration to storage.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a container group named Group1. Group1 contains two Azure container instances as shown in the following table. You need to ensure that container2 can use CPU resources without negatively affecting container1. What should you do?

- **A.** Increase the resource limit of container1 to three CPUs.
- **B.** Increase the resource limit of container2 to six CPUs.
- **C.** Remove the resource limit for both containers. **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Decrease the resource limit of container2 to two CPUs.

**Risposta corretta:** C
> Esibito: q362_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** In a container group, the resource request is what each container is guaranteed, and the resource limit is how far it may burst. container2 requests 3 CPUs but may burst to 4, taking capacity that container1 (2 CPUs) relies on. Without explicit limits each container's maximum usage equals its request, so container2 can use its own 3 CPUs and never encroach on container1. A limit cannot be lower than the request, and raising the limits only increases contention.

- **C.** Azure Container Apps or Azure App Service only **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Azure Container Instances or Azure App Service only
- **E.** Azure Container Apps, Azure Container Instances, or Azure App Service

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** Azure Container Apps scales containers automatically through KEDA-based scale rules (HTTP traffic, CPU, events), and Azure App Service can autoscale the plan that runs a containerized app. Azure Container Instances runs container groups with fixed resources and has no built-in autoscaling: scaling it requires creating or deleting groups yourself.

Solution: You create a private endpoint connection for Registry1. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** A private endpoint gives Registry1 a private IP address in a virtual network, which restricts or changes the network path but provides no credentials. The deployment fails because Azure Container Instances cannot authenticate to the registry, so a private endpoint does not solve it - and ACI can reach a registry behind a private endpoint only in specific configurations.

You have a Standard Azure App Service plan named Plan1. You need to ensure that Plan1 will scale automatically when the CPU usage of the web app exceeds 80 percent. What should you select for Plan1?

- **A.** Automatic in the Scale out method settings
- **B.** Rules Based in the Scale out method settings **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Premium P1 in the Scale up (App Service plan) settings
- **D.** Standard S1 in the Scale up (App Service plan) settings
- **E.** Manual in the Scale out method settings

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Scaling a Standard plan automatically on a metric such as CPU percentage is done with autoscale rules: in Scale out you choose the Rules Based method and add a rule that adds instances when CPU exceeds 80%. Automatic scaling is a Premium v2/v3 feature driven by HTTP traffic rather than CPU rules, Manual keeps a fixed instance count, and scaling up changes the instance size, not the number of instances.

Planned Changes

ADatum plans to implement the following changes:

Configure a data collection rule (DCR) named DCR1 to collect only system events that have an event ID of 4648 from VM2 and VM4.
In storage1, create a new container named cont2 that has the following access policies:
  Three stored access policies named Stored1, Stored2, and Stored3
  A legal hold for immutable blob storage
Whenever possible, use directories to organize storage account content.
Grant User1 the permissions required to link Zone1 to VNet1.
Assign Attribute1 to supported adatum.com resources.
In storage2, create an encryption scope named Scope1.
Deploy new containers by using Image1 or Image2.

Technical Requirements

ADatum must meet the following technical requirements:

Your company has three offices. The offices are located in Miami, Los Angeles, and New York. Each office contains datacenter. You have an Azure subscription that contains resources in the East US and West US Azure regions. Each region contains a virtual network. The virtual networks are peered. You need to connect the datacenters to the subscription. The solution must minimize network latency between the datacenters. What should you create?

- **A.** three Azure Application Gateways and one On-premises data gateway
- **B.** three virtual hubs and one virtual WAN **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** three virtual WANs and one virtual hub
- **D.** three On-premises data gateways and one Azure Application Gateway

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To connect the datacenters in Miami, Los Angeles, and New York to the Azure subscription and minimize network latency, you should create three virtual hubs and one virtual WAN. A virtual WAN provides a centralized management point and optimized routing across regions, while virtual hubs in each region ensure there is a local connection point for each datacenter, thereby reducing latency. Multiple virtual hubs can be created within a single virtual WAN, which allows for efficient and low- latency communication between the datacenters and Azure regions.

You have an Azure virtual network named VNet1 that connects to your on-premises network by using a site-to-site VPN. VNet1 contains one subnet namedSunet1. Subnet1 is associated to a network security group (NSG) named NSG1. Subnet1 contains a basic internal load balancer named ILB1. ILB1 has three Azure virtual machines in the backend pool. You need to collect data about the IP addresses that connects to ILB1. You must be able to run interactive queries from the Azure portal against the collected data. What should you do? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Resource to create -> An Azure Log Analytics workspace | Resource on which to enable diagnostics -> NSG1
> Immagini: q379_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** A basic internal load balancer produces no diagnostic logs of the client IP addresses, but the NSG on Subnet1 sees every flow to the backend VMs. Sending NSG1's data (flow logs with traffic analytics, or diagnostic settings) to a Log Analytics workspace makes it available to interactive KQL queries in the Azure portal; a storage account or Event Grid would not support interactive queries.

You have the Azure virtual networks shown in the following table. To which virtual networks can you establish a peering connection from VNet1?

- **A.** VNet2 andVNet3 only
- **B.** VNet2 only
- **C.** VNet3 and VNet4 only **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** VNet2, VNet3, and VNet4

**Risposta corretta:** C
> Esibito: q380_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To establish a peering connection between virtual networks in Azure, the address spaces of the virtual networks must not overlap. VNet1 has an address space of 10.11.0.0/16. VNet2 has an address space of 10.11.0.0/17, which overlaps with VNet1's address space, making peering between VNet1 and VNet2 impossible. VNet3, with an address space of 10.10.0.0/22, and VNet4, with an address space of 192.168.16.0/22, do not overlap with VNet1's address space. Therefore, VNet1 can establish peering connections with VNet3 and VNet4, but not with VNet2.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 contains four subnets named Gateway, Perimeter, NVA, and Production. The NVA subnet contains two network virtual appliances (NVAs) that will perform network traffic inspection between the Perimeter subnet and the Production subnet. You need to implement an Azure load balancer for the NVAs. The solution must meet the following requirements: The NVAs must run in an active-active configuration that uses automatic failover. The load balancer must load balance traffic to two services on the Production subnet. The services have different IP addresses. Which three actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- **A.** Deploy a basic load balancer
- **B.** Deploy a standard load balancer **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Add two load balancing rules that have HA Ports and Floating IP enabled **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Add two load balancing rules that have HA Ports enabled and Floating IP disabled
- **E.** Add a frontend IP configuration, a backend pool, and a health probe
- **F.** Add a frontend IP configuration, two backend pools, and a health probe **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B, C, F

**Spiegazione:** A standard load balancer is required as it supports HA Ports and the advanced configurations necessary for high availability and automatic failover. Two load balancing rules with HA Ports and Floating IP enabled are necessary to allow both NVAs to be in an active-active configuration, ensuring seamless redundancy. Finally, a frontend IP configuration is needed to direct incoming traffic, along with two backend pools to manage the two services with different IP addresses in the Production subnet, and a health probe to monitor the NVAs. This setup will ensure the load balancer properly balances traffic to the NVAs and between the services, meeting all the requirements stated.

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1 that contains two Azure virtual networks named VNet1 and VNet2. VNet1 contains a VPN gateway named VPNGW1 that uses static routing. There is a site-to-site VPN connection between your on-premises network and VNet1. On a computer named Client1 that runs Windows 10, you configure a point-to-site VPN connection to VNet1. You configure virtual network peering between VNet1 and VNet2. You verify that you can connect to VNet2 from the on-premises network. Client1 is unable to connect to VNet2. You need to ensure that you can connect Client1 to VNet2. What should you do?

- **A.** Download and re-install the VPN client configuration package on Client1. **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Select Allow gateway transit on VNet1.
- **C.** Select Allow gateway transit on VNet2.
- **D.** Enable BGP on VPNGW1

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** The on-premises network can already reach VNet2 through VPNGW1, which means the peering is already configured with gateway transit on VNet1 and use remote gateways on VNet2 - enabling it again changes nothing. A point-to-site client receives its routes from the VPN client configuration package, which is generated for the topology that existed when it was downloaded: after the peering was added, Client1 must download and reinstall the package to learn the route to VNet2.

You have an Azure subscription. The subscription contains virtual machines that run Windows Server 2016 and are configured as shown in the following table. You create a public Azure DNS zone named adatum.com and a private Azure DNS zone named contoso.com. You create a virtual network link for contoso.com as shown in the following exhibit. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** When VM1 starts, a record for VM1 is added to the contoso.com DNS zone. -> Yes | When VM2 starts, a record for VM2 is added to the contoso.com DNS zone. -> Yes | When VM3 starts, a record for VM3 is added to the adatum.com DNS zone. -> No
> Immagini: q383_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** The virtual network link connects contoso.com to VNET2 with auto registration enabled, so every VM in VNET2 - VM1, VM2 and VM3 - gets an A record in contoso.com when it starts. The DNS suffix configured inside Windows Server plays no part in auto registration. adatum.com is a public zone, and auto registration works only with private zones, so no record for VM3 is added there.

- **E.** the subnets on VNet1, VNet2, and VNet3

**Risposta corretta:** D
> Esibito: q384_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** You can only apply NSG1 to subnets that are in the same Azure region as NSG1. In this case, NSG1 is in the East US region. According to the table, VNet3 is the only virtual network also in the East US region. Therefore, NSG1 can only be applied to the subnets on VNet3.

You have an Azure subscription that contains two virtual networks named VNet1 and VNet2. Virtual machines connect to the virtual networks. The virtual networks have the address spaces and the subnets configured as shown in the following table. You need to add the address space of 10.33.0.0/16 to VNet1. The solution must ensure that the hosts on VNet1 and VNet2 can communicate. Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

**Risposta corretta:** 1. Remove peering between VNet1 and VNet2. -> 2. Add the 10.33.0.0/16 address space to VNet1. -> 3. Recreate peering between VNet1 and VNet2.
> Immagini: q385_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Step 1: Remove peering between VNet1 and VNet2. You can't add address ranges to, or delete address ranges from a virtual network's address space once a virtual network is peered with another virtual network. To add or remove address ranges, delete the peering, add or remove the address ranges, then re-create the peering. Step 2: Add the 10.33.0.0/16 address space to VNet1.

NIC1 connects to VNET1. RG2 contains a public IP address named IP2 that is in the East US location. IP2 is not assigned to a virtual machine. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** You can move storage1 to RG2. -> Yes | You can move NIC1 to RG2. -> Yes | If you move IP2 to RG1, the location of IP2 will change. -> No
> Immagini: q386_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Within the same subscription, resources can be moved between resource groups independently of their dependencies, and the region of a resource group doesn't constrain the regions of its resources: storage1 and NIC1 (even while attached to the running VM1) can be moved to RG2. Moving a resource changes only its resource group, never its location, so IP2 stays in East US if it is moved to RG1.

- **C.** Connect webapp1 to VNET1 **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Deploy an Azure Application Gateway

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** Connecting webapp1 to VNET1 will allow the web app to access the resources within the virtual network, including the MySQL database on VM1. The App Service virtual network integration feature enables Azure web apps to access resources within a VNet. Deploying an internal load balancer, peering VNET1 to another network, or using an Azure Application Gateway are unnecessary and less direct solutions for ensuring that the web app can access the data on VM1.

You create an Azure VM named VM1 that runs Windows Server 2019. VM1 is configured as shown in the exhibit. (Click the Exhibit tab.) You need to enable Desired State Configuration for VM1. What should you do first?

- **A.** Connect to VM1.
- **B.** Start VM1. **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Capture a snapshot of VM1.
- **D.** Configure a DNS name for VM1.

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q388_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** The VM is currently in a 'Stopped (deallocated)' state. In order to enable Desired State Configuration (DSC) for VM1, the virtual machine must be running. DSC extensions require communication with Azure, and this can only occur when the VM is active. Therefore, the first step would be to start VM1.

You have five Azure virtual machines that run Windows Server 2016. The virtual machines are configured as web servers. You have an Azure load balancer named LB1 that provides load balancing services for the virtual machines. You need to ensure that visitors are serviced by the same web server for each request. What should you configure?

- **A.** Floating IP (direct server return) to Disabled
- **B.** Session persistence to None
- **C.** Floating IP (direct server return) to Enabled
- **D.** Session persistence to Client IP **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that visitors are serviced by the same web server for each request, you need to configure session persistence. By setting session persistence to Client IP, successive requests from the same client IP address will be handled by the same virtual machine. This setting ensures that the client continues to communicate with the same server, maintaining a consistent session.

Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution. After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources: A virtual network that has a subnet named Subnet1 Two network security groups (NSGs) named NSG-VM1 and NSG-Subnet1 A virtual machine named VM1 that has the required Windows Server configurations to allow Remote Desktop connections NSG-Subnet1 has the default inbound security rules only. NSG-VM1 has the default inbound security rules and the following custom inbound security rule: Priority: 100 Source: Any Source port range: * Destination: * Destination port range: 3389 Protocol: UDP Action: Allow VM1 has a public IP address and is connected to Subnet1. NSG-VM1 is associated to the network interface of VM1. NSG-Subnet1 is associated to Subnet1. You need to be able to establish Remote Desktop connections from the internet to VM1. Solution: You add an inbound security rule to NSG-Subnet1 that allows connections from the Any source to the *destination for port range 3389 and uses the TCP protocol. You remove NSG-VM1 from the network interface of VM1. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To allow Remote Desktop connections (which use TCP port 3389) from the internet to VM1, you need to ensure that there is an NSG rule allowing incoming TCP connections on port 3389. By adding an appropriate inbound rule to NSG-Subnet1 that allows TCP traffic on port 3389 from any source and removing NSG-VM1 (which had a rule using the incorrectly specified UDP protocol), the objective is met. Therefore, the given solution is valid because it ensures that the necessary TCP traffic for Remote Desktop connections can reach VM1.

NSG-VM1 is associated to the network interface of VM1. NSG-Subnet1 is associated to Subnet1. You need to be able to establish Remote Desktop connections from the internet to VM1. Solution: You add an inbound security rule to NSG-Subnet1 that allows connections from the internet source to the VirtualNetwork destination for port range 3389 and uses the UDP protocol. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q391_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** The correct answer is No. Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) uses TCP, not UDP. The default port for RDP is TCP port 3389. For Remote Desktop connections from the internet to be established with VM1, the inbound security rule must allow TCP traffic on port 3389, not UDP. Therefore, adding an inbound security rule to NSG-Subnet1 that allows connections using the UDP protocol does not meet the goal.

Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** Yes. RDP uses TCP port 3389, and inbound traffic from the internet must be allowed by both NSGs: NSG-Subnet1 on the subnet and NSG-VM1 on the network interface. Adding to both a rule that allows TCP 3389 from the Internet service tag to the VirtualNetwork service tag works, because after the public IP is translated the destination is VM1's private address, which is part of VirtualNetwork. The existing UDP rule in NSG-VM1 neither helps nor interferes. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/network-security-group-how-it-works

You have a virtual network named VNet1 that has the configuration shown in the following exhibit. Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic. Note: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Before a virtual machine on VNet1 can receive an IP address from 192.168.1.0/24, you must first -> add an address space | Before a virtual machine on VNet1 can receive an IP address from 10.2.1.0/24, you must first -> add a subnet
> Immagini: q393_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** VNet1's address space is 10.2.0.0/16 and its only subnet, default, uses 10.2.0.0/24. 192.168.1.0/24 is outside the address space, so you must first add it as an address space (and then a subnet in it) before a VM can get an address from that range. 10.2.1.0/24 is already inside the address space but not in any subnet, so you just add a subnet with that prefix.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual network named VNET1. VNET1 contains the subnets shown in the following table. Each virtual machine uses a static IP address. You need to create network security groups (NSGs) to meet following requirements: Allow web requests from the internet to VM3, VM4, VM5, and VM6. Allow all connections between VM1 and VM2. Allow Remote Desktop connections to VM1. Prevent all other network traffic to VNET1. What is the minimum number of NSGs you should create?

- **A.** 1 **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** 3
- **C.** 4
- **D.** 12

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q394_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To meet the specified requirements, the minimum number of NSGs needed is one. This is because NSGs can be associated with multiple subnets, NICs, or VMs. You can create one NSG with rules to allow web requests to static IP addresses of VM3, VM4, VM5, and VM6, allow RDP to the static IP address of VM1, and have an implicit deny rule at the end to prevent all other traffic. This single NSG can then be applied to the entire VNET1, thereby satisfying all the requirements.

Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks
Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines

In RG1, you need to create a new virtual machine named VM2, and then connect VM2 to VNET1. What should you do first?

- **A.** Remove Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines from the policy. **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Create an Azure Resource Manager template
- **C.** Add a subnet to VNET1.
- **D.** Remove Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks from the policy.

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** The Not allowed resource types Azure policy with policy enforcement enabled specifies which resource types are blocked from being deployed in a specific resource group. In this case, both virtual networks and virtual machines are blocked in RG1. To create a new virtual machine in RG1, you must first remove the restriction that blocks the deployment of virtual machines. Therefore, removing Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines from the policy is the necessary step to allow the creation of the new virtual machine.

You have a public load balancer that balances ports 80 and 443 across three virtual machines named VM1, VM2, and VM3. You need to direct all the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections to VM3 only. What should you configure?

- **A.** an inbound NAT rule **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** a new public load balancer for VM3
- **C.** a frontend IP configuration
- **D.** a load balancing rule

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To direct all Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections to a specific virtual machine (VM) within a set of VMs behind a load balancer, you need to configure an inbound NAT rule. An inbound NAT rule allows you to map an external port on the load balancer to an internal port on a specific VM. In this case, you would map the RDP port (3389) on the load balancer to port 3389 on VM3. This ensures that all RDP traffic is directed to VM3, regardless of the load balancing setup for other ports.

> Immagini: q398_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** A Basic load balancer can only use, as its backend pool, VMs in a single availability set (or a single scale set) within the same virtual network - standalone VMs cannot be combined. VM1 and VM2 are both in AS1 in VNet1, so LB1 can balance traffic between them. VM3 and VM4, and VM5 and VM6, are standalone VMs that belong to no availability set, so a Basic SKU load balancer cannot balance them (a Standard load balancer could).

- **A.** Disassociate the NSG from a network interface
- **B.** Change the Port_80 inbound security rule.
- **C.** Associate the NSG to Subnet1. **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Change the DenyWebSites outbound security rule.

**Risposta corretta:** C
> Esibito: q401_pre0.png, q401_pre1.png

**Spiegazione:** To prevent users of VM1 and VM2 from accessing websites on the Internet over TCP port 80, the NSG (Network Security Group) should be associated with Subnet1. The outbound security rule 'DenyWebSites' is already correctly set up to block outbound traffic on port 80. Since the NSG is currently not associated with any subnet or network interface as shown in the image, associating it with Subnet1 will enforce the rule to block the desired traffic.

VNet2 contains an Azure virtual machine named VM2 and has an IP address space of 10.10.0.0/24. You need to connect VNet1 to VNet2. What should you do first?

- **A.** Move VM1 to Subscription2.
- **B.** Move VNet1 to Subscription2.
- **C.** Modify the IP address space of VNet2.
- **D.** Provision virtual network gateways. **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** To connect two virtual networks (VNets) that are in different Azure subscriptions, you need to provision virtual network gateways in each subscription. This creates a VPN (virtual private network) gateway in each VNet. Once these gateways are set up, you can then establish a secure connection between VNet1 and VNet2, effectively enabling communication between them. The IP address spaces of the VNets, in this case, do not overlap, so there's no need to modify them. Moving the virtual machines or the virtual networks themselves does not address the requirement of connecting the VNets, making provisioning virtual network gateways the correct initial step.

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To establish a point-to-site VPN connection to an Azure virtual network (VNet1) from Computer2, you need the client certificate that was used on Computer1. This certificate is essential because it is used for client authentication. Modifying Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication policies will not address the requirement of having the client certificate installed on Computer2. The correct solution involves exporting the client certificate from Computer1 and installing it on Computer2. Without the client certificate, Computer2 will not be able to authenticate and establish the VPN connection to VNet1.

The virtual networks are hosted in separate resource groups.Another administrator plans to create several network security groups (NSGs) in the subscription.You need to ensure that when an NSG is created, it automatically blocks TCP port 8080 between the virtual networks.Solution: You create a resource lock, and then you assign the lock to the subscription.Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Creating a resource lock and assigning it to the subscription will not meet the goal of automatically blocking TCP port 8080 between virtual networks when an NSG is created. Resource locks are used to prevent accidental deletion or modification of Azure resources, but they do not affect the configuration or behavior of resources such as NSGs. To achieve the goal, a custom Azure Policy should be created to enforce a security rule that blocks TCP port 8080. This policy can then be assigned at the subscription level to ensure it applies to all NSGs created within that subscription.

**Spiegazione:** When troubleshooting a remote connection issue to a virtual machine in Azure, one of the first steps is to ensure that the virtual machine is actually running. If VM1 is not started, no connection can be made, regardless of the network settings or rules in place. The rule priorities and network interface settings shown in the exhibit indicate that the necessary settings for RDP are configured correctly, but without the VM being in a running state, these configurations won't be effective.

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that all virtual machines can resolve DNS names using the DNS service on VM1, you must enable connectivity between the virtual networks (VNETs) to allow VMs in different VNETs to communicate with VM1. Virtual network peering is the correct solution for this as it allows different VNETs to communicate with each other, thereby enabling VM2, VM3, and VM4 to access VM1's DNS service. Conditional forwarders, service endpoints, and other configurations alone do not establish the required connectivity between the networks.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the Azure virtual machines shown in the following table. You add inbound security rules to a network security group (NSG) named NSG1 as shown in the following table. You run Azure Network Watcher as shown in the following exhibit. You run Network Watcher again as shown in the following exhibit. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** NSG1 limits VM1 traffic -> No | NSG1 applies to VM2 -> Yes | VM1 and VM2 connect to the same virtual network -> Yes
> Immagini: q411_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** NSG1 allows TCP from 172.16.1.0/24 (VM1's subnet) to 172.16.2.0/24 and denies any other TCP traffic to 172.16.2.0/24, so its rules protect VM2's subnet: NSG1 applies to VM2 and does not restrict VM1's traffic - the TCP 8080 test fails because nothing answers on that port, not because of a deny rule. The ICMP test reaches VM2 in a single hop with VM2's private address as the next hop, which only happens when both VMs are on the same virtual network.

You have the Azure virtual network named VNet1 that contains a subnet named Subnet1. Subnet1 contains three Azure virtual machines. Each virtual machine has a public IP address. The virtual machines host several applications that are accessible over port 443 to users on the Internet. Your on-premises network has a site-to-site VPN connection to VNet1. You discover that the virtual machines can be accessed by using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) from the Internet and from the on-premises network. You need to prevent RDP access to the virtual machines from the Internet, unless the RDP connection is established from the on-premises network. The solution must ensure that all the applications can still be accessed by the Internet users. What should you do?

- **A.** Modify the address space of the local network gateway
- **B.** Create a deny rule in a network security group (NSG) that is linked to Subnet1 **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Remove the public IP addresses from the virtual machines
- **D.** Modify the address space of Subnet1

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To prevent RDP access to the virtual machines from the Internet while allowing access from the on- premises network, you should create a deny rule in a network security group (NSG) that is linked to Subnet1. This rule will block RDP traffic from the Internet while permitting it from the on-premises network through the site-to-site VPN connection. Removing the public IP addresses from the virtual machines would also block the applications that need to be accessible to users over the Internet, so that is not a viable solution. Modifying the address spaces of the local network gateway or Subnet1 would not address the requirement either.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources in the following table. Subnet1 is associated to VNet1. NIC1 attaches VM1 to Subnet1. You need to apply ASG1 to VM1. What should you do?

- **A.** Associate NIC1 to ASG1 **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Modify the properties of ASG1
- **C.** Modify the properties of NSG1

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q413_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To apply an Application Security Group (ASG) to a Virtual Machine (VM) in Azure, you need to connect its Network Interface Card (NIC) to the ASG. This is because an ASG groups NICs logically, and whenever you need to apply security rules to a set of VMs, you do it through their NICs by associating them to the ASG. The other options provided involve modifying properties of the ASG or Network Security Group (NSG), which would not accomplish the task of applying the ASG to the VM.

You have an Azure subscription named Subscription1 that contains an Azure virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 connects to your on-premises network by using Azure ExpressRoute. You plan to prepare the environment for automatic failover in case of ExpressRoute failure. You need to connect VNet1 to the on-premises network by using a site-to-site VPN. The solution must minimize cost. Which three actions should you perform? Each correct answer presents part of the solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- **A.** Create a connection **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Create a local site VPN gateway **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Create a VPN gateway that uses the VpnGw1 SKU **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Create a gateway subnet
- **E.** Create a VPN gateway that uses the Basic SKU

**Risposta corretta:** A, B, C

**Spiegazione:** To connect VNet1 to the on-premises network using a site-to-site VPN while minimizing cost, you need to perform the following actions: Create a local site VPN gateway, as it represents the on- premises VPN device and is essential for establishing the connection; create a VPN gateway that uses the VpnGw1 SKU, as the Basic SKU cannot coexist with an ExpressRoute connection and the VpnGw1 SKU provides the necessary functionality for reliable failover; and finally, create a connection to establish the link between your virtual network and the on-premises network. The gateway subnet can be assumed to already exist due to the existing ExpressRoute connection.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the resources in the following table. You install the Web Server server role (IIS) on VM1 and VM2, and then add VM1 and VM2 to LB1. LB1 is configured as shown in the LB1 exhibit. (Click the LB1 tab.) Rule1 is configured as shown in the Rule1 exhibit. (Click the Rule1 tab.) For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** VM1 is in the same availability set as VM2. -> Yes | If Probe1.htm is present on VM1 and VM2, LB1 will balance TCP port 80 between VM1 and VM2. -> Yes | If you delete Rule1, LB1 will balance all the requests between VM1 and VM2 for all the ports. -> No
> Immagini: q416_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Box 1: Yes - A Basic Load Balancer supports virtual machines in a single availability set or virtual machine scale set. Box 2: Yes - When using load-balancing rules with Azure Load Balancer, you need to specify health probes to allow Load Balancer to detect the backend endpoint status. The configuration of the health probe and probe responses determine which backend pool instances will receive new flows. You can use health probes to detect the failure of an application on a backend endpoint. You can also generate a custom response to a health probe and use the health probe for flow control to manage load or planned downtime. When a health probe fails, Load Balancer will stop sending new flows to the respective unhealthy instance. Outbound connectivity is not impacted, only inbound connectivity is impacted.

Network security group (NSG): None
Private IP address: 10.0.0.4 (dynamic)
Public IP address: 40.90.219.6 (dynamic)

You deploy a standard, Internet-facing load balancer named slb1. You need to configure slb1 to allow connectivity to VM1. Which changes should you apply to VM1 as you configure slb1? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Before you create a backend pool on slb1, you must -> Remove the public IP address from VM1 | Before you can connect to VM1 from slb1, you must -> Create and configure an NSG
> Immagini: q417_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Box 1: Remove the public IP address from VM1 - VM1 has a dynamic public IP address, which is a Basic SKU address, and a Standard load balancer cannot have in its backend pool VMs whose NICs use Basic public IP addresses: remove it (or replace it with a Standard one) before adding VM1 to the backend pool of slb1. Box 2: Create and configure an NSG - A Standard load balancer is secure by default: inbound flows are blocked unless a network security group on the subnet or NIC explicitly allows them, and VM1 has no NSG.

- **D.** East US and West Europe only

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q418_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** Before creating a network interface (NIC), you must have an existing virtual network (VNET) in the same location where the NIC is to be created. In this scenario, the only virtual network available is VNET1, which is located in East US. Therefore, you can only create the NIC in the East US location.

You have Azure virtual machines that run Windows Server 2019 and are configured as shown in the following table. You create a public Azure DNS zone named adatum.com and a private Azure DNS zone named contoso.com. For controso.com, you create a virtual network link named link1 as shown in the exhibit. (Click the Exhibit tab.) You discover that VM1 can resolve names in contoso.com but cannot resolve names in adatum.com. VM1 can resolve other hosts on the Internet. You need to ensure that VM1 can resolve host names in adatum.com.What should you do?

- **A.** Update the DNS suffix on VM1 to be adatum.com
- **B.** Configure the name servers for adatum.com at the domain registrar **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Create an SRV record in the contoso.com zone
- **D.** Modify the Access control (IAM) settings for link1

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q419_pre0.png, q419_pre1.png

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that VM1 can resolve host names in adatum.com, you need to configure the name servers for adatum.com at the domain registrar. This step is crucial because adatum.com is a public Azure DNS zone, and configuring the name servers tells the Internet top-level domain DNS servers where to direct DNS queries for adatum.com. Simply updating the DNS suffix on VM1 or modifying settings within the Azure environment will not suffice, as these actions do not inform the global DNS infrastructure about the location of the adatum.com records.

You plan to use Azure Network Watcher to perform the following tasks: ✑ Task1: Identify a security rule that prevents a network packet from reaching an Azure virtual machine. ✑ Task2: Validate outbound connectivity from an Azure virtual machine to an external host. Which feature should you use for each task? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Task1 -> IP flow verify | Task2 -> Connection troubleshoot
> Immagini: q420_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Box 1: IP flow verify - At some point, a VM may become unable to communicate with other resources, because of a security rule. The IP flow verify capability enables you to specify a source and destination IPv4 address, port, protocol (TCP or UDP), and traffic direction (inbound or outbound). IP flow verify then tests the communication and informs you if the connection succeeds or fails. If the connection fails, IP flow verify tells you which. Box 2: Connection troubleshoot - Diagnose outbound connections from a VM: The connection troubleshoot capability enables you to test a connection between a VM and another VM, an FQDN, a URI, or an IPv4 address. The test returns similar information returned when using the connection monitor capability, but tests the connection at a point in time, rather than monitoring it over time, as connection monitor does.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the resource groups shown in the following table. RG1 contains the resources shown in the following table. You need to identify which resources you can move from RG1 to RG2, and which resources you can move from RG2 to RG1. Which resources should you identify? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Resources that you can move from RG1 to RG2 -> IP1, VNET2, and storage1 | Resources that you can move from RG2 to RG1 -> IP2, VNET2, and storage2
> Immagini: q422_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** A Delete (CanNotDelete) lock prevents deleting a resource or resource group but still allows changes, so it does not block moving resources. The expected answer therefore treats IP1, VNET2 and storage1 (RG1 to RG2) and IP2, VNET2 and storage2 (RG2 to RG1) as movable. Note that the resource names in the exhibit do not match those in the question, and that Microsoft documents that a Read-only lock on the source or destination resource group or subscription blocks moves, so the Read-only lock on VNET2 makes this answer debatable.

**Spiegazione:** To add virtual machines to the backend pool of a Standard SKU load balancer, both VMs must have either a Standard SKU public IP or no public IP at all. In the given scenario, VM1 currently does not have any public IP, and VM2 has a Basic SKU public IP. By creating a Standard SKU public IP and associating it with VM1, you meet the criteria for VM1. However, for VM2, having a Basic SKU public IP is not compliant with the Standard SKU load balancer requirements. Therefore, stopping VM2 will not change the fact that it still has a Basic SKU public IP, which makes the solution incorrect.

**Spiegazione:** Yes. A Standard load balancer cannot have in its backend pool VMs whose network interfaces use Basic SKU public IP addresses; VMs with no public IP or with Standard SKU public IPs are fine. VM1 has no public IP, and VM2 has a Basic one: associating a Standard SKU public IP to each network interface replaces VM2's Basic address, so both VMs end up with Standard public IPs and can be added to LB1. The public IPs are not needed by an internal load balancer, but they do not prevent it. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/skus

You have an Azure virtual machine named VM1. The network interface for VM1 is configured as shown in the exhibit. (Click the Exhibit tab.) You deploy a web server on VM1, and then create a secure website that is accessible by using the HTTPS protocol. VM1 is used as a web server only. You need to ensure that users can connect to the website from the Internet. What should you do?

- **A.** Modify the protocol of Rule4
- **B.** Delete Rule1

- **D.** Create a new inbound rule that allows TCP protocol 443 and configure the rule to have a priority of 501.

**Risposta corretta:** C
> Esibito: q427_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** HTTPS uses port 443. Rule2, with priority 500, denies HTTPS traffic. Rule5, with priority changed from 2000 to 401, would allow HTTPS traffic. Note: Priority is a number between 100 and 4096. Rules are processed in priority order, with lower numbers processed before higher numbers, because lower numbers have higher priority. Once traffic matches a rule, processing stops. As a result, any rules that exist with lower priorities (higher numbers) that have the same attributes as rules with higher priorities are not processed.

Solution: From the Resource providers blade, you unregister the Microsoft.ClassicNetwork provider. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Unregistering the Microsoft.ClassicNetwork provider does not affect the creation of new network security groups (NSGs) or their default settings. To ensure that a specific rule, such as blocking TCP port 8080 between the virtual networks, is automatically applied to all newly created NSGs, you would need to use Azure Policy. Azure Policy allows you to define and enforce rules for resources in your subscription, including custom policies that dictate the configuration of NSGs. By using a custom policy definition, you can ensure that specific security rules are automatically applied to new NSGs.

**Spiegazione:** VNET1 (10.10.10.0/24) has a single subnet that uses its whole address space, so there is no room for the GatewaySubnet a VPN gateway needs: a site-to-site (or VNet-to-VNet) connection cannot be set up for VNET1 without first changing its address space. Peering only requires non-overlapping address spaces, and works across regions and subscriptions: VNET1 does not overlap with VNET2 (172.16.0.0/16) nor with VNETA (10.10.128.0/17), so it can be peered with both.

You need to ensure that connections to App1 can be established successfully from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443. Solution: You create an inbound security rule that denies all traffic from the 131.107.100.50 source and has a cost of 64999. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q430_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To ensure connections to App1 can be established successfully from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443, you must ensure that the security rules allow this specific traffic. The existing rules already include an Allow rule with priority 100 for this exact traffic (source: 131.107.100.50, destination: VirtualNetwork, port: 443, protocol: TCP). Creating an additional deny rule with priority 64999 would not help because it would still be overridden by the existing Allow rule with priority 100. The issue could be due to other factors such as the state of the virtual machine, the network configuration, or the presence of other higher priority rules. Creating a deny rule as proposed does not meet the goal of allowing the connection.

Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q431_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** The issue arises because the 'BlockAllOther443' rule with priority 200 is blocking traffic on TCP port 443, despite the existence of an 'Allow_131.107.100.50' rule with priority 100 that should allow the traffic. By deleting the 'BlockAllOther443' rule, traffic from 131.107.100.50 on port 443 will no longer be blocked. Additionally, the 'AllowAzureLoadBalancerInbound' rule with priority 65001 will allow traffic from the Azure Load Balancer, resolving the issue. Thus, deleting the 'BlockAllOther443' rule will ensure that connections to App1 can be successfully established from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443.

Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution. After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You have an app named App1 that is installed on two Azure virtual machines named VM1 and VM2. Connections to App1 are managed by using an Azure Load Balancer. The effective network security configurations for VM2 are shown in the following exhibit. You discover that connections to App1 from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443 fail. You verify that the Load Balancer rules are configured correctly. You need to ensure that connections to App1 can be established successfully from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443. Solution: You modify the priority of the Allow_131.107.100.50 inbound security rule. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q432_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** The given solution proposes modifying the priority of the 'Allow_131.107.100.50' inbound security rule to resolve the issue, but this rule already has the highest priority of 100. Therefore, changing its priority would have no effect. The problem lies elsewhere in the network security group (NSG) rules configuration, likely due to another rule blocking the necessary traffic. Consequently, modifying the priority of the existing rule does not meet the goal of ensuring successful connections to App1 from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443.

Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution. After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You have an Azure subscription that contains 10 virtual networks. The virtual networks are hosted in separate resource groups. Another administrator plans to create several network security groups (NSGs) in the subscription. You need to ensure that when an NSG is created, it automatically blocks TCP port 8080 between the virtual networks. Solution: You assign a built-in policy definition to the subscription. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that any newly created network security group (NSG) automatically blocks TCP port 8080 between virtual networks, one would need a specific policy addressing this particular rule. Azure's built-in policy definitions might not cover this exact requirement. Therefore, creating a custom policy definition specifying the block on TCP port 8080 is necessary. Built-in policies cover more general scenarios and may not include every specific custom rule needed. Thus, simply assigning a built-in policy definition to the subscription is insufficient to meet the stated goal.

You have an Azure subscription. You plan to deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster to support an app named App1. On- premises clients connect to App1 by using the IP address of the pod. For the AKS cluster, you need to choose a network type that will support App1. What should you choose?

- **A.** kubenet
- **B.** Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Hybrid Connection endpoints
- **D.** Azure Private Link

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To support on-premises clients connecting to App1 using the IP address of the pod, the Azure Container Networking Interface (CNI) is the appropriate network type. This is because with Azure CNI, each pod gets its own IP address from the subnet and can be accessed directly, which suits the requirement of on-premises clients connecting via IP addresses. Other options such as kubenet use Network Address Translation (NAT) which complicates direct IP access to the pods, and the other options, Hybrid Connection endpoints and Azure Private Link, are not viable for this requirement.

As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You have an Azure subscription that contains the virtual machines shown in the following table. You deploy a load balancer that has the following configurations: Name: LB1 Type: Internal SKU: Standard Virtual network: VNET1 You need to ensure that you can add VM1 and VM2 to the backend pool of LB1. Solution: You disassociate the public IP address from the network interface of VM2. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q435_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To add virtual machines to the backend pool of an Azure load balancer with a Standard SKU, the VMs must either have a Standard SKU public IP or no public IP. In this scenario, disassociating the Basic SKU public IP from VM2 would make both VMs either have no public IP or a compatible Standard SKU public IP. Therefore, disassociating the public IP address from the network interface of VM2 meets the goal of adding both VM1 and VM2 to the backend pool of the load balancer.

Another administrator plans to create several network security groups (NSGs) in the subscription.

Solution: You configure a custom policy definition, and then you assign the policy to the subscription. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Nota: Risposta corretta a mano da No a Yes: una custom policy con effetto append (o modify/deployIfNotExists) sull'alias securityRules[*] aggiunge la regola di Deny su TCP 8080 a ogni NSG creato nello scope. La spiegazione originale sosteneva che una policy non puo' configurare gli NSG, il che e' falso per questi effetti.

**Spiegazione:** Azure Policy can do more than audit or deny: some effects change the resource while it is being created. A custom policy definition that targets Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups and uses the append effect on the Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups/securityRules[*] alias adds a security rule to every new NSG, here a Deny rule for TCP port 8080 between the virtual networks' address spaces (the modify or deployIfNotExists effects can reach the same result). Assigned at the subscription scope, it applies to every NSG the other administrator creates, whatever resource group it lands in. This is also why a custom definition is needed: no built-in policy definition adds this specific rule, which is why assigning a built-in definition does not meet the goal.

You have two Azure virtual networks named VNet1 and VNet2. VNet1 contains an Azure virtual machine named VM1. VNet2 contains an Azure virtual machine named VM2. VM1 hosts a frontend application that connects to VM2 to retrieve data.Users report that the frontend application is slower than usual. You need to view the average round-trip time (RTT) of the packets from VM1 to VM2. Which Azure Network Watcher feature should you use?

- **A.** IP flow verify
- **B.** Connection troubleshoot
- **C.** Connection monitor **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** NSG flow logs

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To view the average round-trip time (RTT) of the packets from VM1 to VM2, the most appropriate Azure Network Watcher feature is the connection monitor. Connection monitor allows you to continuously monitor the connection between two virtual machines and provides detailed information about reachability, latency, and network topology changes over time. This feature is specifically designed to measure and display metrics such as average, minimum, and maximum latency, which aligns with the requirement to view the average RTT.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the public load balancers shown in the following table. You plan to create six virtual machines and to load balance requests to the virtual machines. Each load balancer will load balance three virtual machines. You need to create the virtual machines for the planned solution. How should you create the virtual machines? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

You have an on-premises data center and an Azure subscription. The data center contains two VPN devices. The subscription contains an Azure virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 contains a gateway subnet. You need to create a site-to-site VPN. The solution must ensure that if a single instance of an Azure VPN gateway fails, or a single on-premises VPN device fails, the failure will not cause an interruption that is longer than two minutes. What is the minimum number of public IP addresses, virtual network gateways, and local network gateways required in Azure? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Public IP addresses -> 2 | Virtual network gateways -> 1 | Local network gateways -> 2
> Esibito: q439_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To survive the failure of one Azure gateway instance within two minutes, the VPN gateway must run in active-active mode: still a single virtual network gateway, but with two instances and one public IP address each, so 2 public IP addresses. To survive the failure of one on-premises device, each of the two VPN devices must be represented by its own local network gateway with its own connection (with BGP), giving a full mesh of four tunnels: 2 local network gateways.

You need to ensure that connections to App1 can be established successfully from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443. Solution: You create an inbound security rule that allows any traffic from the AzureLoadBalancer source and has a cost of 150. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q441_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** Yes. Traffic from 131.107.100.50 on TCP 443 is already allowed by the Allow_131.107.100.50 rule (priority 100). The connections fail because BlockAllOther443 (priority 200) denies port 443 from every other source, including the Azure Load Balancer health probe: the probe fails, VM2 is marked unhealthy and the load balancer stops sending it traffic. A rule that allows the AzureLoadBalancer source with priority 150 is evaluated before BlockAllOther443, so the probe succeeds again and App1 becomes reachable.

**Risposta corretta:** C, E

**Spiegazione:** To configure a point-to-site connection from an on-premises computer to an Azure virtual network, you need to use a route-based virtual network gateway, as point-to-site connections are only supported by route-based gateways. Therefore, first, you should delete the existing policy-based virtual network gateway, as it does not support point-to-site connections. Next, you should create a new route-based virtual network gateway to enable the point-to-site connectivity.

> Immagini: q443_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Box 1: No - Automatic registration works only for VMs in the virtual network linked to the zone as the registration network: VNet2. VM5 is in VNet1, so no record is added for it. Box 2: No - Name resolution in a private zone works only from virtual networks linked to it; VNet1 is not linked to adatum.com at all, so VM5 cannot resolve VM9.adatum.com. Box 3: Yes - VM6 is in VNet2, the registration network, which can also resolve the zone, and the zone contains an A record for vm9.

You add virtual network links to the private DNS zones as shown in the following table. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** You can enable auto registration for Link2. -> Yes | You can add a virtual network link for VNET1 to Zone3.com. -> Yes | You can add a virtual network link for VNET2 to Zone1.com and enable auto registration. -> Yes
> Immagini: q444_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** A virtual network can be linked to many private DNS zones but can have auto registration enabled on only one of them. VNET2 has only Link2 (to Zone2.com, auto registration off), so auto registration can be turned on for Link2, or alternatively a new link from VNET2 to Zone1.com can be created with auto registration enabled. Private DNS zones are global resources, so the region shown for Zone3.com does not prevent linking it to VNET1 in West US.

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** Packet capture is a network diagnostic tool provided by Azure Network Watcher that allows you to intercept and record network packets from or to a virtual machine. By creating a packet capture session, all network traffic between VM1 and VM2 can be captured and inspected for a specific duration, in this case, three hours. This solution meets the goal because it enables detailed traffic analysis, capturing all relevant network activity between the two VMs. Azure Network Watcher's packet capture is specifically designed for such tasks, making it the appropriate tool for the requirements stated in the question.

**Spiegazione:** The goal is to inspect all network traffic from VM1 to VM2 for a period of three hours. Creating a Data Collector Set (DCS) in Performance Monitor is not an appropriate solution for this task, as it is typically used to collect performance data from the local machine, not to inspect network traffic between virtual machines. Instead, the correct approach would involve using network monitoring tools specifically designed for capturing and analyzing network traffic, such as Azure Network Watcher's packet capture feature. This tool is capable of capturing and analyzing network traffic between virtual machines in an Azure environment, which aligns with the requirement of inspecting network traffic between VM1 and VM2.

You have a virtual network named VNet1 as shown in the exhibit. (Click the Exhibit tab.) No devices are connected to VNet1. You plan to peer VNet1 to another virtual network named VNet2. VNet2 has an address space of 10.2.0.0/16. You need to create the peering. What should you do first?

- **A.** Modify the address space of VNet1. **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Add a gateway subnet to VNet1.
- **C.** Create a subnet on VNet1 and VNet2.
- **D.** Configure a service endpoint on VNet2.

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q454_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** The virtual networks you intend to peer must have non-overlapping IP address spaces. In the given exhibit, VNet1 and VNet2 both have the address space 10.2.0.0/16, which would cause an overlap. Therefore, the first step in creating the peering is to modify the address space of VNet1 to ensure there is no overlap with VNet2. This change is necessary to meet the requirements for peering virtual networks in Azure.

You have the Azure virtual machines shown in the following table. VNET1 is linked to a private DNS zone named contoso.com that contains the records shown in the following table. You need to ping VM2 from VM1. Which DNS names can you use to ping VM2?

- **A.** comp2.contoso.com and comp4.contoso.com only
- **B.** comp1.contoso.com, comp2.contoso.com, comp3.contoso.com, and comp4.contoso.com
- **C.** comp2.contoso.com only **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** comp1.contoso.com and comp2.contoso.com only
- **E.** comp1.contoso.com, comp2.contoso.com, and comp4.contoso.com only

**Risposta corretta:** C
> Esibito: q455_pre0.png, q455_pre1.png

**Spiegazione:** To successfully ping VM2, a DNS name that resolves to its IP address (10.0.0.5) is required. The record types in the DNS zone are: TXT, A, CNAME, and PTR. TXT records are text-based and not resolvable to IP addresses for pinging. PTR records are used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping IP addresses to domain names and are not used for pinging. CNAME records are aliases and resolve to the domain names they point to. However, the CNAME record in question points to a TXT record, making it ineffective for pinging. Therefore, the only relevant DNS name is the one associated with the A record, which is comp2.contoso.com. Hence, the correct option is comp2.contoso.com only.

You have a network security group (NSG) named NSG1 that has the rules defined in the exhibit. (Click the Exhibit tab.) NSG1 is associated to a subnet named Subnet1. Subnet1 contains the virtual machines shown in the following table. You need to add a rule to NSG1 to ensure that VM1 can ping VM2. The solution must use the principle of LEAST privilege. How should you configure the rule? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Direction -> Outbound | Source -> 10.1.0.10 | Destination -> 10.1.0.11 | Priority -> 110
> Immagini: q456_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** NSG1 contains an outbound DENY_PING rule (priority 111) that blocks ICMP from the VirtualNetwork tag to anywhere, so VM1's echo requests never leave the subnet. With least privilege, add an outbound rule that allows ICMP from VM1 (10.1.0.10) to VM2 (10.1.0.11) with priority 110, so it is evaluated before 111. The inbound side needs nothing: the default AllowVnetInBound rule already admits the traffic, and NSGs are stateful, so the replies are allowed too.

Note: This question is part of a series of questions that present the same scenario. Each question in the series contains a unique solution that might meet the stated goals. Some question sets might have more than one correct solution, while others might not have a correct solution. After you answer a question in this section, you will NOT be able to return to it. As a result, these questions will not appear in the review screen. You have a computer named Computer1 that has a point-to-site VPN connection to an Azure virtual network named VNet1. The point-to-site connection uses a self-signed certificate. From Azure, you download and install the VPN client configuration package on a computer named Computer2. You need to ensure that you can establish a point-to-site VPN connection to VNet1 from Computer2. Solution: On Computer2, you set the Startup type for the IPSec Policy Agent service to Automatic. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes
- **B.** No **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To establish a point-to-site VPN connection from Computer2 to the Azure virtual network VNet1, it is essential that Computer2 has the client certificate installed. The client certificate must be generated from the self-signed root certificate and then exported from Computer1 and installed on Computer2. Setting the Startup type for the IPSec Policy Agent service to Automatic on Computer2 will not suffice to meet the goal, as the installation of the client certificate is the necessary step for authentication to succeed.

You have five Azure virtual machines that run Windows Server 2016. The virtual machines are configured as web servers. You have an Azure load balancer named LB1 that provides load balancing services for the virtual machines. You need to ensure that visitors are serviced by the same web server for each request. What should you configure?

- **A.** Session persistence to Client IP and protocol **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Protocol to UDP
- **C.** Session persistence to None
- **D.** Floating IP (direct server return) to Enabled

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that visitors are serviced by the same web server for each request, you need to configure session persistence. Specifically, configuring session persistence to Client IP and protocol ensures that successive requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination will be handled by the same virtual machine. This is necessary to maintain session consistency for web servers where session state or data might depend on the same server handling multiple requests from the same client.

You have an Azure subscription. You are deploying an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster that will contain multiple pods. The pods will use kubernet networking. You need to restrict network traffic between the pods. What should you configure on the AKS cluster?

- **A.** the Azure network policy
- **B.** the Calico network policy **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** pod security policies
- **D.** an application security group

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To restrict network traffic between pods in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster using kubenet networking, you should configure the Calico network policy. Calico supports both Azure CNI and kubenet networking, which makes it suitable for this scenario. Azure network policy, on the other hand, only supports Azure CNI and would not be applicable here. Pod security policies and application security groups do not provide the necessary control for restricting pod-to-pod network traffic.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a virtual network named VNet1. VNet1 uses an IP address space of 10.0.0.0/16 and contains the VPN Gateway and subnets in the following table: Subnet1 contains a virtual appliance named VM1 that operates as a router. You create a routing table named RT1. You need to route all inbound traffic from the VPN gateway to VNet1 through VM1. How should you configure RT1? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Address prefix -> 10.0.0.0/16 | Next hop type -> Virtual appliance | Assigned to -> GatewaySubnet
> Immagini: q461_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Traffic arriving from the VPN gateway is routed by the routes of the GatewaySubnet, so RT1 must be associated to GatewaySubnet. The route covers the whole virtual network, 10.0.0.0/16, with next hop type Virtual appliance and VM1's private IP address as the next hop, so every packet from on-premises to VNet1 is sent through VM1 first. Associating it to Subnet0 or to Subnet1 and Subnet2 would affect traffic leaving those subnets, not traffic coming in from the gateway.

You have five Azure virtual machines that run Windows Server 2016. The virtual machines are configured as web servers. You have an Azure load balancer named LB1 that provides load balancing services for the virtual machines. You need to ensure that visitors are serviced by the same web server for each request. What should you configure?

- **A.** Floating IP (direct server return) to Enabled
- **B.** Floating IP (direct server return) to Disabled
- **C.** a health probe
- **D.** Session persistence to Client IP and Protocol **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** In order to ensure that visitors are serviced by the same web server for each request, you need to configure session persistence on the Azure load balancer. Session persistence, also known as sticky sessions, ensures that requests from the same client are always directed to the same backend server. Specifically, setting 'Session Persistence' to 'Client IP and Protocol' will achieve this. This configuration makes sure that successive requests from the same client IP address and protocol combination will be handled by the same backend server, fulfilling the requirement.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the virtual machines shown in the following table: VM1 and VM2 use public IP addresses. From Windows Server 2019 on VM1 and VM2, you allow inbound Remote Desktop connections. Subnet1 and Subnet2 are in a virtual network named VNET1. The subscription contains two network security groups (NSGs) named NSG1 and NSG2. NSG1 uses only the default rules. NSG2 uses the default rules and the following custom incoming rule: Priority: 100 Name: Rule1 Port: 3389 Protocol: TCP Source: Any Destination: Any Action: Allow NSG1 is associated to Subnet1. NSG2 is associated to the network interface of VM2. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** From the Internet, you can connect to VM1 by using Remote Desktop. -> No | From the Internet, you can connect to VM2 by using Remote Desktop. -> Yes | From VM1, you can connect to VM2 by using Remote Desktop -> Yes
> Immagini: q463_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** VM1 is in Subnet1, protected by NSG1, which has only the default rules: inbound traffic from the internet is denied (DenyAllInBound), so Remote Desktop to VM1 from the internet fails. VM2's NIC has NSG2, whose Rule1 allows TCP 3389 from any source, and Subnet2 has no NSG, so RDP from the internet to VM2 works. From VM1 to VM2 the traffic stays inside VNET1: NSG1 allows outbound traffic by default and NSG2 allows it inbound (Rule1, and the default AllowVnetInBound rule).

You have an Azure subscription that contains two virtual machines named VM1 and VM2. You create an Azure load balancer. You plan to create a load balancing rule that will load balance HTTPS traffic between VM1 and VM2. Which two additional load balancer resources should you create before you can create the load balancing rule? Each correct answer presents part of the solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- **A.** a frontend IP address **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** an inbound NAT rule
- **C.** a virtual network
- **D.** a backend pool **← CORRETTA**
- **E.** a health probe

**Risposta corretta:** A, D

**Spiegazione:** To create a load balancing rule for HTTPS traffic between VM1 and VM2 using an Azure load balancer, you need to define a frontend IP address and a backend pool. The frontend IP address acts as the entry point for incoming traffic, allowing the load balancer to distribute this traffic to the backend resources. The backend pool is necessary to specify which virtual machines (VM1 and VM2) will receive the load-balanced traffic. These two elements are essential to establishing the load balancing rule. While health probes are also important for monitoring the health of backend resources, they are not a prerequisite for creating the load balancing rule itself.

You have an on-premises network that contains a database server named dbserver1. You have an Azure subscription. You plan to deploy three Azure virtual machines. Each virtual machine will be deployed to a separate availability zone. You need to configure an Azure VPN gateway for a site-to-site VPN. The solution must ensure that the virtual machines can connect to dbserver1. Which type of public IP address SKU and assignment should you use for the gateway?

- **A.** a basic SKU and a static IP address assignment
- **B.** a standard SKU and a static IP address assignment **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** a basic SKU and a dynamic IP address assignment

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To set up an Azure VPN gateway for a site-to-site VPN that allows virtual machines in separate availability zones to connect to an on-premises database server, you need a Standard SKU and a static IP address assignment. This is because the Standard SKU supports availability zones, ensuring high availability and redundancy across zones. Additionally, when configuring a Standard SKU for a public IP address, the assignment is static by default, providing a consistent address required for reliable VPN connections.

**Risposta corretta:** VM1 can connect to contoso2024 by using 131.107.10.10. -> Yes | VM2 can connect to contoso2024 by using 150.120.10.10. -> Yes | VM3 must use its private IP address to connect to contoso2024. -> No
> Immagini: q466_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** contoso2024 accepts traffic only from selected networks: Subnet1 of VNet1 through a service endpoint, and the IP ranges 131.107.10.10, 150.120.10.10 and 170.20.10.10. VM2 sits in Subnet2, which has no service endpoint, so it reaches the account from its public IP 150.120.10.10, which is allowed. VM1 and VM3 are in Subnet1: with the service endpoint enabled their requests reach the storage account over the Azure backbone from their private addresses, which the virtual network rule allows, so VM3 is not forced to use one address or the other. Note that the expected answer also treats VM1 as connecting with its public IP. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-network-security

You have two Azure virtual machines as shown in the following table. You create the Azure DNS zones shown in the following table. You perform the following actions:

To fabrikam.com, you add a virtual network link to vnet1 and enable auto registration.
For contoso.com, you assign vm1 and vm2 the Owner role.

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** The DNS A record for vm1 is added to contoso.com and has the IP address of 131.107.50.20. -> No | The DNS A record for vm1 is added to fabrikam.com and has the IP address of 10.0.1.4. -> Yes | The DNS A record for vm2 is added to fabrikam.com and has the IP address of 10.0.1.5. -> Yes
> Immagini: q467_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Auto registration works only with private DNS zones linked to the VM's virtual network: fabrikam.com is private and linked to vnet1 with auto registration enabled, so vm1 and vm2 are registered there with their private addresses, 10.0.1.4 and 10.0.1.5. contoso.com is a public zone: assigning the VMs the Owner role does not register anything, and public IPs are never auto-registered. The DNS suffix configured inside the operating system does not matter. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-autoregistration

Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** VM2 can connect to the TCP port 1433 services on VM1. -> No | VM1 can connect to the TCP port 1433 services on VM2. -> Yes | VM2 can connect to the TCP port 1433 services on VM3. -> Yes
> Immagini: q469_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Traffic to VM1 must pass both NSG1 (on Subnet1) and NSG2 (on VM1's NIC). NSG1 allows TCP 1433 from Subnet2, but NSG2 blocks TCP 1433 from VM2 (10.10.2.5) to VM1, so VM2 cannot reach VM1's port 1433. Subnet2 and the NICs of VM2 and VM3 have no NSG, so nothing filters traffic into them: VM1 can reach port 1433 on VM2 (NSG1 and NSG2 allow outbound traffic by default), and VM2 can reach VM3 on the same subnet.

> Immagini: q470_post0.png, q470_post1.png

**Spiegazione:** IP forwarding enables the virtual machine a network interface is attached to: ✑ Receive network traffic not destined for one of the IP addresses assigned to any of the IP configurations assigned to the network interface. Send network traffic with a different source IP address than the one assigned to one of a network interface's IP configurations. The setting must be enabled for every network interface that is attached to the virtual machine that receives traffic that the virtual machine needs to forward. A virtual machine can forward traffic whether it has multiple network interfaces or a single network interface attached to it. Box 1: Yes - The routing table allows connections from VM3 to VM1 and VM2. And as IP forwarding is enabled on VM3, VM3 can connect to VM1. Box 2: No - VM3, which has IP forwarding, must be turned on, in order for VM2 to connect to VM1. Box 3: Yes - The routing table allows connections from VM1 and VM2 to VM3.

Your on-premises network contains an SMB share named Share1. You have an Azure subscription that contains the following resources:

A web app named webapp1
A virtual network named VNET1

You need to ensure that webapp1 can connect to Share1. What should you deploy?

- **A.** an Azure Application Gateway
- **B.** an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Application Proxy
- **C.** an Azure Virtual Network Gateway **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that the web app can connect to the on-premises SMB share, you need a connection between the on-premises network and the Azure virtual network. An Azure Virtual Network Gateway facilitates this by creating a Site-to-Site VPN connection, allowing secure communication between the two networks. This is necessary because the web app needs network connectivity to the SMB share, which can be achieved through the virtual network that the web app and the gateway are part of.

**Spiegazione:** To enable inbound access to virtual machines via Azure Bastion, you should configure the network security group (NSG) to allow traffic on port 443. Azure Bastion uses HTTPS (port 443) to securely access the virtual machines through its web interface. This port is crucial for establishing the secure connections needed for remote desktop and SSH sessions to the VMs. Other ports like 22, 389, and 8080 are not used for this purpose by Azure Bastion.

Your network contains an on-premises Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) domain named contoso.com. The domain contains the servers shown in the following table. You plan to migrate contoso.com to Azure. You create an Azure virtual network named VNET1 that has the following settings:

Address space: 10.0.0.0/16
Subnet:
Name: Subnet1
IPv4: 10.0.1.0/24

You need to move DC1 to VNET1. The solution must ensure that the member servers in contoso.com can resolve AD DS DNS names. How should you configure DC1? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** IP address -> Use 10.0.1.3 | Name resolution -> Configure VNET1 to use a custom DNS server
> Esibito: q480_pre0.png, q480_pre1.png

**Spiegazione:** IP address: once DC1 is in Subnet1 (10.0.1.0/24) it needs an address from that range that does not change, such as 10.0.1.3, set as a static private IP on its network interface in Azure. Name resolution: AD DS relies on DNS records (SRV and others) that domain controllers register dynamically, and an Azure Private DNS zone does not accept dynamic updates from domain controllers. The member servers must therefore use DC1 itself as their DNS server, which you do by configuring VNET1 with a custom DNS server pointing to DC1's IP address.

You have an on-premises network. You have an Azure subscription that contains three virtual networks named VNET1. VNET2. and VNET3. The virtual networks are peered and connected to the on-premises network. The subscription contains the virtual machines shown in the following table. You need to monitor connectivity between the virtual machines and the on-premises network by using Connection Monitor. What is the minimum number of connection monitors you should deploy?

- **A.** 1
- **B.** 2 **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** 3
- **D.** 4

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q483_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To monitor connectivity between the virtual machines and the on-premises network using Connection Monitor, you need to consider the region-specific nature of the Connection Monitor resource in Azure Network Watcher. In this scenario, the virtual machines are located in two different regions: West US and Central US. As Connection Monitor is region-specific, you need to deploy one Connection Monitor in each region to cover all virtual machines. Therefore, the minimum number of connection monitors required is 2.

You plan to deploy the following Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** LB1 will be connected to a subnet named VNET1/netname -> No | LB1 can be deployed only to the resource group that contains VNET1 -> No | The value of the sku variable can be provided as a parameter when the template is deployed from a command prompt -> No
> Immagini: q484_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** The frontend subnet ID is built from variables('vnetId') plus /subnets/ and variables('netname'), which is APP1, so LB1 connects to the subnet APP1 of VNET1 - not to a subnet literally named VNET1/netname. A load balancer does not have to be in the same resource group as its virtual network; note, though, that this template builds VNET1's ID with resourceId() without a resource group, which resolves to the deployment's own resource group. sku is defined in the variables section, and variables cannot be supplied at deployment time - only parameters can.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a storage account. The account stores website data. You need to ensure that inbound user traffic uses the Microsoft point-of-presence (POP) closest to the user's location. What should you configure?

- **A.** private endpoints
- **B.** Azure Firewall rules
- **C.** Routing preference **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** load balancing

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that inbound user traffic uses the Microsoft point-of-presence (POP) closest to the user's location, you should configure routing preference. Routing preference in Azure allows you to specify how traffic should be routed, ensuring that it takes the most optimized and low-latency path through the Microsoft global network. This configuration ensures that traffic will use the closest point-of- presence (POP) to the user's location, delivering better performance and reliability for accessing the storage account.

You have two Azure virtual machines named VM1 and VM2 that run Windows Server. The virtual machines are in a subnet named Subnet1. Subnet1 is in a virtual network named VNet1. You need to prevent VM1 from accessing VM2 on port 3389. What should you do?

- **A.** Create a network security group (NSG) that has an outbound security rule to deny destination port 3389 and apply the NSG to the network interface of VM1. **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** Configure Azure Bastion in VNet1.
- **C.** Create a network security group (NSG) that has an outbound security rule to deny source port 3389 and apply the NSG to Subnet1.
- **D.** Create a network security group (NSG) that has an inbound security rule to deny source port 3389 and apply the NSG to Subnet1.

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To prevent VM1 from accessing VM2 on port 3389, you need to create a network security group (NSG) with an outbound security rule that denies traffic to the destination port 3389 and apply this NSG to the network interface of VM1. This ensures that VM1 cannot initiate connections to VM2 on port 3389, effectively blocking the desired access while leaving other communication channels unaffected. Configuring a rule for the source port 3389 would be incorrect as outbound connections from VM1 generally use a random high port number.

- **A.** Configure the Hybrid Connection Manager.
- **B.** Upgrade ASP1 to the Premium SKU.
- **C.** Create a route table. **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** Create an Azure Network Watcher.

**Risposta corretta:** C
> Esibito: q487_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To manage outbound traffic from a virtual network using an Azure Firewall, you need to create a user-defined route table. This route table directs the traffic from the virtual network (VNET1) to the firewall (Firewall1). This process overrides the default routing behavior and ensures that all outbound traffic is managed by the firewall. Configuring Hybrid Connection Manager, upgrading the App Service plan, or creating an Azure Network Watcher are not directly related to setting up outbound traffic management via the firewall.

**Spiegazione:** Azure Bastion is a service that provides secure and seamless RDP/SSH connectivity to virtual machines within a virtual network. It allows you to connect to the virtual machine using your browser and the Azure portal, or via the native SSH or RDP client already installed on your local computer. Therefore, the primary resource that Azure Bastion can protect is the virtual machine (VM1). Web apps and Azure AD DS domains are not suitable for Azure Bastion access, as they do not require or utilize RDP/SSH connectivity for such management functions. Consequently, VM1 is the only resource that can be protected by using Bastion1.

You have an Azure subscription that contains 10 virtual machines and the resources shown in the following table. You need to ensure that Server1 can support 100 concurrent SSH users. The solution must minimize administrative effort. What should you do first?

- **A.** Resize the subnet of Bastion1
- **B.** Configure host scaling.
- **C.** Create a network security group (NSG)
- **D.** Upgrade Bastion1 to the Standard SKU **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D
> Esibito: q491_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that Bastion1 can support 100 concurrent SSH users, the first step should be upgrading Bastion1 to the Standard SKU. The Basic SKU only supports up to 40 concurrent SSH connections per instance, with a maximum of two instances, thus supporting up to 80 concurrent SSH connections. The Standard SKU allows for host scaling, where more instances can be added, thereby supporting a higher number of concurrent connections. Resizing the subnet or creating a network security group would not directly increase the concurrent SSH connection capacity.

Which three actions should you perform in sequence? To answer, move the appropriate actions from the list of actions to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

**Risposta corretta:** 1. Upgrade Bastion1 to the Standard SKU. -> 2. From Bastion1, select Native Client Support. -> 3. From Azure CLI on Device1, run az network bastion rdp.
> Immagini: q493_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Connecting to VM1 through Bastion with the native Remote Desktop client of Device1 requires the native client support feature, which is available only in the Standard (or Premium) SKU. So you upgrade Bastion1 to Standard, enable Native Client Support in its configuration, and then run az network bastion rdp from Azure CLI on Device1, which opens the tunnel and launches mstsc for you. Running mstsc.exe directly would try to reach VM1 without going through Bastion. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/connect-vm-native-client-windows

You discover that connections to App1 from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443 fail. You verify that the Load Balancer rules are configured correctly. You need to ensure that connections to App1 can be established successfully from 131.107.100.50 over TCP port 443. Solution: You create an inbound security rule that allows any traffic from the AzureLoadBalancer source and has a priority of 150. Does this meet the goal?

- **A.** Yes **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** No

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q505_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** Yes. Traffic from 131.107.100.50 on TCP 443 is already allowed by the Allow_131.107.100.50 rule (priority 100). The connections fail because BlockAllOther443 (priority 200) also blocks the Azure Load Balancer health probe on port 443: the probe fails, VM2 is marked unhealthy and receives no traffic. A rule that allows the AzureLoadBalancer source with priority 150 is evaluated before BlockAllOther443, so the probe succeeds and App1 becomes reachable.

VNet1 (10.1.128.0/23) already uses half of its space for Subnet1, and VNet2's address space is fully taken by Subnet21 and Subnet22, so only VNet3 (172.16.0.0/16) has room for a new /23 subnet. Note that workload-profiles environments, now the default, accept subnets as small as /27. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-apps/networking

You have an Azure subscription that contains the virtual networks shown in the following table. All the virtual networks are peered. Each virtual network contains nine virtual machines. You need to configure secure RDP connections to the virtual machines by using Azure Bastion. What is the minimum number of Bastion hosts required?

- **A.** 1 **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** 3
- **C.** 9
- **D.** 10

**Risposta corretta:** A
> Esibito: q509_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** Azure Bastion can be used with Virtual Network peering, and it supports both Virtual Network peering which connects virtual networks within the same Azure region and Global Virtual Network peering which connects virtual networks across different regions. With VM peering configured, a single Bastion host can manage secure RDP or SSH connections to all virtual machines within the peered virtual networks, regardless of the region. Thus, only one Bastion host is required to securely connect to all the virtual machines across the peered virtual networks in the Azure subscription.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the virtual networks shown in the following table. The subscription contains the virtual machines shown in the following table. Each virtual machine contains only a private IP address. You create an Azure bastion for VNet1 as shown in the following exhibit. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** The Remote Desktop Connection client (mstsc.exe) can be used to connect to VM1 through Bastion1. -> No | The Azure portal can use SSH to connect to VM2 through Bastion1. -> Yes | The Azure portal can be used to connect to VM3 through Bastion1. -> No
> Immagini: q510_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Bastion1 uses the Basic tier, which supports connections only from the Azure portal; native clients such as mstsc.exe require the Standard tier or higher. Bastion can reach VMs in directly peered virtual networks: VNet2 is peered with VNet1, so the portal can open an SSH session to VM2 (Linux). VNet3 is peered only with VNet2, and peering is not transitive, so VM3 cannot be reached through Bastion1. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bastion/vnet-peering

You have an Azure subscription that contains the virtual networks shown in the following table. The subscription contains the subnets shown in the following table. The subscription contains the storage accounts shown in the following table. You create a service endpoint policy named Policy1 in the South Central US Azure region to allow connectivity to all the storage accounts in the subscription. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Policy1 can be applied to Subnet3. -> Yes | Only storage1 and storage2 can be accessed from VNet2. -> No | Only storage2 can be accessed from VNet3. -> No
> Immagini: q511_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** A service endpoint policy can be applied only to subnets in the same region that have the Microsoft.Storage service endpoint: Policy1 is in South Central US, so it can be applied to Subnet3 in VNet3. Policy1 is not applied to VNet2, so its storage service endpoint reaches every storage account, not only storage1 and storage2. Even on VNet3, Policy1 allows all the storage accounts of the subscription, so access is not limited to storage2.

You have an Azure virtual network named VNet1 that contains the following settings:

IPv4 address space: 172.16.10.0/24
Subnet name: Subnet1
Subnet address range: 172.16.10.0/25

What is the maximum number of virtual machines that can connect to Subnet1?

- **A.** 24
- **B.** 25
- **C.** 123 **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** 128
- **E.** 251

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** Subnet1 is a /25, which has 128 addresses. Azure reserves five addresses in every subnet: the network address, the first three host addresses (default gateway and two for Azure DNS) and the broadcast address. That leaves 128 - 5 = 123 addresses for virtual machines.

You have an Azure subscription that contains a resource group named RG1 and a virtual network named VNet1. You plan to create an Azure container instance named container1. You need to be able to configure DNS name label scope reuse for container1. What should you configure for container1?

- **A.** the private networking type
- **B.** the public networking type **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** a new subnet on VNet1
- **D.** a confidential SKU

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To configure DNS name label scope reuse for an Azure container instance, you must use the public networking type. This allows the container instance to be accessed from the internet and ensures that the DNS name label is globally unique within Azure. The private networking type would not enable access from the public internet, making DNS name label scope reuse irrelevant in that context. Configuring a new subnet or selecting a confidential SKU does not relate to DNS name label scope reuse either.

You have the Azure virtual machines shown in the following table. VNET1, VNET2, and VNET3 are peered. VM4 has a DNS server that is authoritative for a zone named contoso.com and contains the records shown in the following table. The virtual networks are configured to use the DNS servers shown in the following table. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** From VM1, server1.contoso.com resolves to 131.107.3.3. -> No | From VM2, server1.contoso.com resolves to 131.107.3.3. -> Yes | From VM3, server2.contoso.com resolves to 131.107.2.4. -> No
> Immagini: q514_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** VNET1 uses Azure-provided DNS, which knows nothing about the contoso.com zone hosted on VM4, so VM1 cannot resolve server1.contoso.com. VNET2 and VNET3 use VM4 (192.168.0.5) as their custom DNS server, and the peering lets VM2 reach it, so VM2 resolves server1.contoso.com to 131.107.3.3. From VM3, server2.contoso.com resolves to 131.107.3.4, not 131.107.2.4. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances

VM1 must support the capture of performance data. You need to specify resource dependencies for the ARM template. In which order should you deploy the resources? To answer, move all resources from the list of resources to the answer area and arrange them in the correct order.

**Risposta corretta:** 1. virtual network -> 2. network interface -> 3. virtual machine -> 4. Azure Monitor extension
> Immagini: q515_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Resources are deployed in dependency order: the virtual network first, then the network interface that connects to its subnet, then the virtual machine that uses the network interface, and finally the Azure Monitor extension, which is installed on the running VM to collect performance data. Each resource lists the previous one in its dependsOn section. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/resource-dependency

You have an Azure subscription. You are creating a new Azure container instance that will have the following settings: Container name: cont1 SKU: Standard OS type: Windows Networking type: Public Memory (GiB): 2.5 Number of CPU cores: 2 You discover that the Private setting for Networking type is unavailable. You need to ensure that cont1 can be configured to use private networking. Which setting should you change?

- **A.** Memory (GiB)
- **B.** Networking type
- **C.** Number of CPU cores
- **D.** OS type **← CORRETTA**
- **E.** SKU

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that the Azure container instance can be configured to use private networking, you need to change the OS type. Private networking for Azure Container Instances is only supported for Linux containers and not for Windows containers. The restriction on private networking applies specifically to the OS type, making it necessary to switch from a Windows-based container to a Linux-based container.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the virtual networks shown in the following table. The subscription contains the virtual machines shown in the following table. All the virtual machines have only private IP addresses. You deploy an Azure Bastion host named Bastion1 to VNet1. To which virtual machines can you connect through Bastion1?

- **A.** VM1 only
- **B.** VM1 and VM2 only **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** VM1 and VM3 only
- **D.** VM1, VM2, and VM3

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q517_pre0.png, q517_pre1.png

**Spiegazione:** Azure Bastion is a service that allows you to securely connect to virtual machines (VMs) in your virtual network (VNet) without exposing them to the public internet. Bastion can connect to VMs in different VNets if those VNets are peered. In this case, Bastion1 is deployed in VNet1, which is peered with VNet2. Therefore, it can connect to VM1 (located in VNet1) and VM2 (located in VNet2). However, VNet3 is only peered with VNet2 and not with VNet1. Without transitive peering or gateway transit, Bastion1 cannot connect to VM3. Thus, the correct answer is VM1 and VM2.

You have the Azure virtual networks shown in the following table. Which virtual networks can you peer with VNet1?

- **A.** VNet2, VNet3, and VNet4
- **B.** VNet2 only
- **C.** VNet3 and VNet4 only **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** VNet2 and VNet3 only

**Risposta corretta:** C
> Esibito: q518_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** You can peer virtual networks as long as their address spaces do not overlap. In this scenario, VNet1 has an address space of 10.11.0.0/16, which overlaps with VNet2's address space of 10.11.0.0/17. Due to this overlap, VNet1 cannot be peered with VNet2. VNet3 has an address space of 10.10.0.0/22, and VNet4 has an address space of 192.168.16.0/22, both of which do not overlap with VNet1's address space. Therefore, VNet1 can be peered with VNet3 and VNet4 only.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the virtual networks shown in the following table. Each virtual network has 50 connected virtual machines. You need to implement Azure Bastion. The solution must meet the fallowing requirements: Support host scaling. Support uploading and downloading files. Support the virtual machines on both VNet1 and VNet2. Minimize the number of addresses on the Azure Bastion subnet. How should you configure Azure Bastion? To answer, select the options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct answer is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** Subnet size -> /26 | Public IP -> Standard SKU with a static allocation
> Immagini: q520_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Host scaling and file upload and download are Standard (or Premium) tier features of Azure Bastion, and a single Bastion in VNet1 can reach the VMs of the peered VNet2. A Bastion that supports host scaling needs an AzureBastionSubnet of at least /26, the smallest of the valid options, and Azure Bastion always requires a Standard SKU public IP address with static allocation.

- **A.** a private endpoint
- **B.** peering **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Express Route
- **D.** a route table

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q521_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that all traffic between VNet1 and VNet2 traverses the Microsoft backbone network, you should configure peering. Virtual network peering in Azure allows you to connect virtual networks seamlessly, making them appear as one for connectivity purposes. Traffic between virtual machines in peered virtual networks uses the Microsoft backbone infrastructure, ensuring efficient and optimized routing. This method leverages Azure's high-performance backbone infrastructure for inter-VNet traffic.

You have an Azure subscription that contains two peered virtual networks named VNet1 and VNet2. VNet1 has a VPN gateway that uses static routing, The on-premises network has a VPN connection that uses the VPN gateway of VNet1. You need to configure access for users on the on-premises network to connect to a virtual machine on VNet2. The solution must minimize costs. Which type of connectivity should you use?

- **A.** Azure Firewall with a private IP address
- **B.** service chaining and user-defined routes (UDRs) **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Azure Application Gateway
- **D.** ExpressRoute circuits to VNet2

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** VNet2 has no gateway of its own, so on-premises traffic must use VNet1's VPN gateway through the peering. Service chaining lets user-defined routes in a peered network point to a gateway or appliance in the other network: with gateway transit on the peering (VNet1 allows it, VNet2 uses the remote gateway) and the appropriate UDRs, on-premises users reach the VM in VNet2 without paying for a second gateway, an ExpressRoute circuit, an Azure Firewall or an Application Gateway.

- **A.** a local network gateway
- **B.** a route table that has custom routes **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** a service endpoint
- **D.** IP address reservations

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** Peered virtual networks route traffic to each other directly through the system routes created by the peering. To force VNet1-to-VNet2 traffic through NetVA1 you create a route table with a custom route for VNet2's address space, next hop type Virtual appliance and NetVA1's IP address, and associate it with VNet1's subnets (IP forwarding must be enabled on the NVA's NIC).

- **A.** an action group **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** a mail-enabled security group
- **C.** a distribution group
- **D.** a Microsoft 365 group

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that the alert rule sends an email message to two users, you should create an action group in Azure Monitor. An action group is a collection of notification preferences and actions that are used by Azure Monitor to notify users when an alert is triggered. Action groups can be customized to send email notifications to specific users, making it the appropriate choice for this requirement.

**Spiegazione:** The alert rule is set to use the action group AG1, which is configured to email the Monitoring Reader role. Both User1 and User2 will receive the email notification. User1 is directly assigned the Monitoring Reader role, while User2 inherits this role through membership in Group1, which is assigned the Monitoring Reader role. Managed identities, such as Principal1 and Principal2, do not have associated email addresses and thus cannot receive email notifications. Therefore, emails will only be sent to Azure AD user members of the Monitoring Reader role directly or through group membership, making User1 and User2 the recipients.

Modify the size of VM1.
Copy a file named Budget.xls to a folder named Data.
Reset the password for the built-in administrator account.
Add a data disk to VM1.

An administrator uses the Replace existing option to restore VM1 from Backup1. You need to ensure that all the changes to VM1 are restored. Which change should you perform again?

- **A.** Modify the size of VM1.
- **B.** Reset the password for the built-in administrator account.
- **C.** Add a data disk.
- **D.** Copy Budget.xls to Data. **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** Restoring a virtual machine from a backup using the 'Replace existing' option will revert the VM to its state at the time the backup was created. This means any changes made after the backup will be lost. Modifying the size of the VM, resetting the password, and adding a data disk do not need to be redone because the restore process either retains these changes or requires simple configuration tweaks. The file 'Budget.xls' copied to a folder named 'Data' after the backup will be lost and must be copied again to ensure it is available.

Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** On January 15, 2021, App1 will have only one backup in storage. -> No | On February 6, 2021, you can access the backup of the App2 test slot from January 15, 2021. -> No | On January 15, 2021, you can restore the App2 production slot backup from January 6 to the App2 test slot. -> Yes
> Immagini: q534_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** A retention of 0 days means App Service keeps backups indefinitely, so on January 15 App1 has a backup for every day since January 6, not only one. Backups are configured for the production slots only, so there is no backup of the App2 test slot to access on February 6.

The domain contains the users shown in the following table. You enable self-service password reset (SSPR) for all users and configure SSPR to have the following authentication methods:

Number of methods required to reset: 2
Methods available to users: Mobile phone, Security questions
Number of questions required to register: 3
Number of questions required to reset: 3

You select the following security questions:

What is your favorite food?
In what city was your first job?
What was the name of your first pet?

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** SecAdmin1 must answer the following question during the self-service password reset: In what city was your first job? -> No | BillAdmin1 must answer the following question during the self-service password reset: What is your favorite food? -> No | User1 must answer the following question during the self-service password reset: What was the name of your first pet? -> Yes
> Immagini: q535_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Administrators, SecAdmin1 and BillAdmin1 included, are always subject to the administrator reset policy, which requires two strong methods (email, phone, authenticator app) and never uses security questions, so neither of them answers a security question. User1 follows the configured policy: three questions are required to register and three to reset, and only three questions are selected in total, so User1 registers all three and must answer all of them, including the one about the first pet.

You have a subnet named Subnet1 that contains Azure virtual machines. A network security group (NSG) named NSG1 is associated to Subnet1. NSG1 only contains the default rules. You need to create a rule in NSG1 to prevent the hosts on Subnet1 form connecting to the Azure portal. The hosts must be able to connect to other internet hosts. To what should you set Destination in the rule?

- **A.** Application security group
- **B.** IP Addresses **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Service Tag
- **D.** Any

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To create a rule in NSG1 to prevent hosts on Subnet1 from connecting to the Azure portal while allowing them to connect to other internet hosts, you should set the Destination in the rule to IP Addresses. The Azure portal can be accessed via a specific set of IP addresses. By creating a rule in NSG1 that blocks traffic to these IP addresses, you can effectively prevent hosts on Subnet1 from accessing the Azure portal while still allowing them to connect to other internet hosts. Using general tags or groups like service tags or application security groups would not provide the precise control needed for this task.

The solution must meet the following requirements: The virtual machines connected to VNET1 must be able to communicate with the virtual machines connected to VNET2 by using the Microsoft backbone. The virtual machines connected to VNET1 must be able to access storage1, storage2, and Azure AD by using the Microsoft backbone. What is the minimum number of service endpoints you should add to VNET1?

- **A.** 1
- **B.** 2 **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** 3
- **D.** 5

**Risposta corretta:** B
> Esibito: q561_pre0.png

**Spiegazione:** VM-to-VM traffic between VNET1 and VNET2 stays on the Microsoft backbone through virtual network peering, which needs no service endpoint. Service endpoints are needed only for the platform services: one Microsoft.Storage endpoint covers both storage1 and storage2, and one Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory endpoint covers Azure AD. That makes 2 service endpoints on VNET1. Reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-service-endpoints-overview

You have an Azure subscription named Sub1 that contains the resources shown in the following table. Sub1 contains the following alert rule:

Name: Alert1
Scope: All resource groups in Sub1 (include all future resources)
Condition: All administrative operations
Actions: Action1

Sub1 contains the following alert processing rule:

Name: Rule1
Scope: Sub1
Rule type: Suppress notifications
Apply the rule: On a specific time
Start: August 10, 2022
End: August 13, 2022

For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** If you create a resource group in Sub1 on August 11, 2022, Alert1 is listed in the Azure portal. -> Yes | If you create a resource group in Sub1 on August 12, 2022, an email message is sent to admin1@contoso.com. -> No | If you add a tag to RG1 on August 15, 2022, an email message is sent to admin1@contoso.com. -> Yes
> Immagini: q564_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Alert1 fires on every administrative operation in Sub1, and Rule1 suppresses only the notifications - not the alerts - from August 10 to August 13. Creating a resource group on August 11 therefore still fires Alert1, which is listed in the portal, but a resource group created on August 12 sends no email because Action1 is suppressed. On August 15 the processing rule has expired, so adding a tag to RG1 fires Alert1 and Action1 emails admin1@contoso.com.

You deploy Azure virtual machines to three Azure regions Each region contains a virtual network. Each virtual network contains multiple subnets peered in a full mesh topology. Each subnet contains a network security group (NSG) that has defined rules. A user reports that he cannot use port 33000 to connect from a virtual machine in one region to a virtual machine in another region. Which two options can you use to diagnose the issue? Each correct answer presents a complete solution. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

- **A.** Azure Virtual Network Manager
- **B.** IP flow verify **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** Azure Monitor Network Insights
- **D.** Connection troubleshoot **← CORRETTA**
- **E.** elective security rules

**Risposta corretta:** B, D

**Spiegazione:** To diagnose connectivity issues between virtual machines across Azure regions, particularly when port 33000 is involved, you can use both IP flow verify and Connection troubleshoot. IP flow verify helps check if traffic is being allowed or denied based on network security group (NSG) rules, providing insight into whether a specific rule is blocking the traffic. Connection troubleshoot provides the capability to test direct TCP connections between virtual machines, helping identify whether the issue lies within the NSGs, firewall rules, or any other network configuration. Together, these tools provide a comprehensive approach to diagnosing connectivity issues in a complex network environment.

You create a Recovery Services vault backup policy named Policy1 as shown in the following exhibit: Use the drop-down menus to select the answer choice that completes each statement based on the information presented in the graphic. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** The backup that occurs on Sunday, March 1, will be retained for [answer choice]. -> 10 years | The backup that occurs on Sunday, November 1, will be retained for [answer choice]. -> 36 months
> Immagini: q572_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Policy1 takes a single backup every day at 11:00 PM UTC; the retention rules do not create extra backups, they tag that same daily backup point depending on the date it falls on. Daily: every backup point is kept for 30 days. Weekly: the backup taken on a Sunday is kept for 10 weeks. Monthly (Day Based): the backup taken on day 1 of each month is kept for 36 months. Yearly (Day Based): the backup taken on March 1 is kept for 10 years. Day Based means the rule matches a calendar date (day 1, March 1); Week Based would instead match a weekday position, such as the first Sunday of the month. When a backup point matches more than one rule, the retentions do not add up and no copies are made: the point is kept for the longest of the matching retentions. To read any date, check whether it is a Sunday, whether it is day 1 of the month and whether it is March 1, then take the longest retention among the rules that apply. Sunday, March 1 matches daily, weekly, monthly and yearly, so the yearly rule wins: 10 years. Sunday, November 1 matches daily, weekly and monthly, but not yearly, so the monthly rule wins: 36 months. The Instant Restore setting (2 days) is unrelated: it keeps local snapshots next to the VM for faster restores and is not part of the vault retention range.

You have an Azure subscription that contains the vaults shown in the following table. You deploy the virtual machines shown in the following table. You have the backup policies shown in the following table. For each of the following statements, select Yes if the statement is true. Otherwise, select No. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** VM1 can be backed up by using Policy1. -> Yes | VM2 can be backed up by using Policy3. -> No | VM2 can be backed up by using Policy2. -> Yes
> Immagini: q573_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** Azure VMs are backed up with Recovery Services vault policies. VM1 uses Azure Disk Encryption, which the Standard policy supports, so Policy1 works. VM2 uses Trusted launch, which requires an Enhanced policy, so it can be backed up with Policy2. Policy3 belongs to a Backup vault, which protects workloads such as disks and blobs but not Azure VMs, so it can't back up VM2.

You have an Azure subscription. The subscription contains virtual machines that connect to a virtual network named VNet1. You plan to configure Azure Monitor for VM Insights. You need to ensure that all the virtual machines only communicate with Azure Monitor through VNet1. What should you create first?

- **A.** a data collection rule (DCR)
- **B.** a Log Analytics workspace
- **C.** an Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS) **← CORRETTA**
- **D.** a private endpoint

**Risposta corretta:** C

**Spiegazione:** To ensure that all the virtual machines only communicate with Azure Monitor through VNet1, you should create an Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS) first. This allows you to define the set of Azure Monitor resources that can be accessed through a private endpoint. By creating the AMPLS, you can then configure a private endpoint within VNet1 to ensure secure and private communication between the virtual machines and Azure Monitor, without exposure to the public internet.

- **A.** Out-of-Order Events
- **B.** Output Events
- **C.** Late Input Events
- **D.** Backlogged Input Events **← CORRETTA**

**Risposta corretta:** D

**Spiegazione:** To monitor input events for an Azure Stream Analytics job and identify the number of events that were NOT processed, you should use the 'Backlogged Input Events' metric. This metric represents the number of input events that are waiting to be processed due to issues such as query errors, throttling, or other processing limitations. A nonzero value for this metric implies that your job can't keep up with the number of incoming events, indicating unprocessed events.

You have an Azure subscription. The subscription contains virtual machines that run Windows Server. You have a data collection rule (DCR) named Rule1. You plan to use the Azure Monitor Agent to collect events from Windows System event logs. You only need to collect system events that have an ID of 1001. Which type of query should you use for the data source in Rule1?

- **A.** SQL
- **B.** XPath **← CORRETTA**
- **C.** KQL

**Risposta corretta:** B

**Spiegazione:** To collect events from Windows System event logs that have a specific Event ID, you should use an XPath query. XPath is designed for querying XML documents, and Windows Event Logs are formatted as XML. This allows you to precisely filter the events you want to collect based on attributes like Event ID. SQL is used for querying relational databases and is not applicable here. KQL is used for querying data in Azure Monitor logs and would typically be used after data collection, not for setting up the data collection rule itself.

You have an Azure subscription. The subscription contains 10 virtual machines that run Windows Server. Each virtual machine hosts a website in IIS and has the Azure Monitor Agent installed. You need to collect the IIS logs from each virtual machine and store them in a Log Analytics workspace. What should you configure first?

- **A.** a data collection endpoint **← CORRETTA**
- **B.** an Azure Monitor Private Link Scope (AMPLS)
- **C.** Diagnostic settings
- **D.** VM insights
- **E.** a private endpoint

**Risposta corretta:** A

**Spiegazione:** With the Azure Monitor Agent, IIS logs are collected by a data collection rule (DCR) that has an IIS Logs data source and a Log Analytics workspace destination, where the records land in the W3CIISLog table; the DCR for IIS (and text) logs is paired with a data collection endpoint, which is therefore the first thing to create. Diagnostic settings of a VM belong to the legacy Windows Azure Diagnostics extension, not to the Azure Monitor Agent, and VM insights, AMPLS and private endpoints don't collect IIS logs.

ADatum has an Azure subscription that contains three resource groups named RG1, RG2, and RG3. The subscription contains the storage accounts shown in the following table. The subscription contains the virtual machines shown in the following table. The subscription has an Azure container registry that contains the images shown in the following table. The subscription contains the resources shown in the following table.

Azure Key Vault

The subscription contains an Azure key vault named Vault1. Vault1 contains the certificates shown in the following table. Vault1 contains the keys shown in the following table.

Microsoft Entra Environment

ADatum has a Microsoft Entra tenant named adatum.com that is linked to the Azure subscription and contains the users shown in the following table. The tenant contains the groups shown in the following table. The adatum.com tenant has a custom security attribute named Attribute1.

Planned Changes

ADatum plans to implement the following changes:

Configure a data collection rule (DCR) named DCR1 to collect only system events that have an event ID of 4648 from VM2 and VM4.
In storage1, create a new container named cont2 that has the following access policies:
  Three stored access policies named Stored1, Stored2, and Stored3
  A legal hold for immutable blob storage
Whenever possible, use directories to organize storage account content.
Grant User1 the permissions required to link Zone1 to VNet1.
Assign Attribute1 to supported adatum.com resources.
In storage2, create an encryption scope named Scope1.
Deploy new containers by using Image1 or Image2.

Technical Requirements

ADatum must meet the following technical requirements:

Use TLS for WebApp1.
Follow the principle of least privilege.
Grant permissions at the required scope only.
Ensure that Scope1 is used to encrypt storage services.
Use Azure Backup to back up cont1 and share1 as frequently as possible.
Whenever possible, use Azure Disk Encryption and a key encryption key (KEK) to encrypt the virtual machines.

You need to configure Azure Backup to meet the technical requirements for cont1 and share1. To what should you set the backup frequency for each resource? To answer, select the appropriate options in the answer area. NOTE: Each correct selection is worth one point.

**Risposta corretta:** cont1 -> Daily | share1 -> Every 4 hours
> Immagini: q584_post0.png

**Spiegazione:** cont1 is a blob container: vaulted backup for Azure Blobs runs on a daily schedule at most (operational backup is continuous, with no frequency to set), so the most frequent option is Daily. share1 is an Azure file share: its backup policy can take multiple snapshots per day, up to six, so every 4 hours is the most frequent option.
